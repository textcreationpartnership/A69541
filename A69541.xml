            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I had nothing but <hi>Thanks</hi> to return him: And the rest having shewed me the Incongruity of some Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the crudity of some Passages, received friendly my Answers in the little Matters that we differed in, which were rather about the <hi>Aptness of Notions,</hi> than the <hi>Truth of Matter.</hi> None of these were intended for Publick view, nor on <hi>my part</hi> were fit for it; for I wrote but in order to my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning. But at last, my Friend, Mr. <hi>Sound,</hi> who interceded between us for Communication of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, made me think, that Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was not willing, that so large Pains, as he had taken, should be so buried: But I could not return him his <hi>Exceptions</hi> as he desired, because they were lost, (and I had no mind to be very inquisitive after them, in order to a Publick view) But some years after his death, they were found again.</p>
            <p>Being somewhat clearer in those Matters by all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore: so that twenty years Silence made me think my Brethren pretty well satisfied, and the great fall of <hi>Antinomanism</hi> made me think that my Labour had not been in vain. But lately Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> in a Book called <hi>Justificatio Paulina</hi> hath Written, as you may see.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61305:3"/>
            <p> Since all these Books, and in twenty fours years time (from the first) my conceptions of these Matters (unless I were very stupid) must needs be much ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordered: I better discern what Notions are to be left out, and what Method is to be used as most apt for true Elucidation; I more discern than heretofore, how much of the Controversie is real, and how much verbal, which <hi>Le Blank</hi> and <hi>G. Forbes</hi> have useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened, besides many others; and which in my <hi>Cathol. Theol.</hi> I have partly shewed, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in a <hi>Methodus Theologiae</hi> not Printed: It was therefore many ways a trouble to me, that Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> should fall upon the <hi>Aphorisms</hi> without taking notice of any of the foresaid <hi>Explications</hi> or <hi>Defences;</hi> much more that he did it <hi>in such a manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supposing that a particular Answer to all his Words would be but uselesly to do <hi>a little</hi> of that, which I had <hi>fullier</hi> done before, having returned here so much as I thought necessary, I have published my <hi>Papers and Mr. Cartwrights</hi> instead of the rest: And I have given you <hi>entirely Mr. Cartwrights last,</hi> though I answer but the Summe of them, so far as we differ, meerly lest I should wrong the Dead, by suppressing so learned and elaborate a Treatise, which I think he desired should not be suppressed. And if any think that he is <hi>unanswered,</hi> I leave them to profit by what-ever they shall find in him, which they think is against me, and passed by. He was a very Learned, Peaceable, Godly Man, known by his Rabbinical Commentary, and his <hi>Defence</hi> of King <hi>Charles I.</hi> against the Marquess of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Successor to Mr <hi>W. Fenner</hi> in the <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-shire</hi> Lecture against <hi>Popery,</hi> and after Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in <hi>York:</hi> You may see that his acquaintance with <hi>Protestant Writers</hi> was very great, whose steps in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb facs="tcp:61305:4"/> he was loth to leave, however he went not with the part that was for the <hi>Imputation of the Active Righteousness</hi> and freely differeth in some other things.</p>
            <p>The first piece <hi>[of Imputed Righteousness]</hi> was written hastily on another occasion about three or four years ago: But for the brevity of the argumentative part was cast by, with an intent to perfect it if I had time: Which being never like to have, upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed assault from Dr. <hi>Tully,</hi> I thought it best to let it go as it is; this <hi>latter part</hi> which answereth <hi>him</hi> being newly annexed; as also the <hi>Answer</hi> to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Letter.</p>
            <p>My strait is very great in dealing with this worthy Man: It grieveth me unfeignedly to dishonour or grieve him: But had his Book been as much against <hi>my Person only,</hi> and as little touched the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of the Church, as Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s against me did (to whom he dedicateth it) perhaps Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal had commanded me silently to bear all, for the sake of Peace. But where <hi>Truth, Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are joyntly interested, Respect to Man will not warrant me to desert them: And it greatly troubleth me that his <hi>Words</hi> are such, as cannot be <hi>truly opened and answered</hi> as they <hi>are,</hi> without somewhat which will displease: And Guilt is tender, and Self-love strong, and few Men judg of their own cause and words, as they would do of anothers; but if I have let fall any where any <hi>such words</hi> as <hi>his Letter</hi> hath <hi>many,</hi> or if I repeat the <hi>[Insanis, deliras, &amp;c.]</hi> as oft as <hi>Beza</hi> did against <hi>Illyricus,</hi> or use such words as <hi>Calvin</hi> did against <hi>Baldwin,</hi> or as other such Persons have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily used, with whom I am not worthy to be named, and who are deservedly honoured by him and me, when I <hi>find</hi> them, I shall <hi>repent</hi> of them, and I desire him
<pb facs="tcp:61305:4"/> that seeth any unwarrantable Sharpness, which I see not, not to imitate it; but in judging still to observe the <hi>Necessity of the Cause.</hi> Though I lay not the Churches Concord and Mens Salvation upon <hi>Logical</hi> Definitions and Methods; yet I take <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>well-interpreted apt Names and Notions</hi> to be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great use to our clear distinct understanding of the Matter, and I fear no Censure more from my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, than of <hi>Over-doing</hi> in that part: And I oft wonder at my self, to find how I grow more and more in Love, both with the <hi>Primitive simplicity,</hi> and with <hi>accurateness of Notions</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> which seem to some to be contrary. But I find that it is the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> that I more and more value, as our <hi>Bread and Drink, our Food and Work,</hi> which must princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally take up <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and be the <hi>Matter and Means</hi> of our <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>one another,</hi> our <hi>comfort in Life and Death,</hi> and the terms of the <hi>Churches Peace and Concord,</hi> if ever we shall see such a blessed day, and be delivered from proud unreasonable Men. And it is principally for <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>greater Clearness,</hi> and the <hi>ending</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Controversies,</hi> and the <hi>perfecting</hi> of our Minds with a <hi>delightful useful higher</hi> knowledg, and the more skilful managing sacred things, that I value and desire the <hi>latter.</hi> And while we agree in the former, I can differ from any in the latter, with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to Christian Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>If this worthy Person be over-angry with me, it is my duty to see that I deserve it not, and that I be not over-angry with him: Alas, the opening of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ignorance is a small part of our suffering from one another here. (Nay why is it not our gain, and matter of thanks, if <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Selfishness</hi> prevail
<pb facs="tcp:61305:5"/> not: And if they do, alas, we have greater evils to lament!) If I cannot love those, that have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed utterly to ruine me in the World, and taken from me m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Now come to a Believer going out of the World, and ask him, what hope he hath to be saved: He will be ready to say, I know that Christ is come into the World, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and I know that I am one of them that have a part in Him: I know that I have fulfilled the Conditions, as that I should not continue willingly in any known sin, that I should love the Lord Jesus, and desire to serve Him above all: I know that I have fulfilled these Conditions; and for all this, I have the Word f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IF thou blame me for writing again, on a Subject which I have written on so oft, and so lately (specially in my <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> and Disputations of Justification) I shall not blame thee for so doing; but I shall excuse my self by telling thee my reasons. 1. The occasion is many loud accusations of my self, of which I have before given an account. I publish it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I see the Contention still so hot in the Church of Christ, and mens Charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed against each other; one side calling the other <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the other <hi>Libertines,</hi> (who are neither of them <hi>Christians)</hi> and if I mistake not, for the most part in the dark about <hi>one Phrase,</hi> and that of mens devising, rather than about the sence: But if indeed it be the sence that they differ about, it's time to do our best to rectifie such Fundamental Errours.</p>
                  <p>I find that all of us agree in all the Phrases of Scripture. And a Mans Sence is no way known but by his expressions: The
<pb facs="tcp:61305:11"/> question is then, Which is the <hi>necessary Phrase</hi> which we must express our sence by? We all say that to Believers, <hi>Christ is made our Righteousness; We are made the Righteousness of God in him; He hath ransomed, redeemed us, as a Sacrifice for our sins, a price; He hath merited and obtained eternal Redemption for us, that Sin is remitted, covered, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; that Righteousness is Reckoned or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us; that Faith is Imputed to us for Righteousness,</hi> and any thing else that is in the Scripture. But all this will not serve to make us Christians! What is wanting? Why, we must say that <hi>Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Imputed to us as ours, and that Christ satisfied for our sins!</hi> Well; The thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified seemeth to us true and good and needful, (though the Scripture hath as good words for it as any of us can invent.) We consent therefore to use these Phrases, so be it you put no false and wicked sence on them by <hi>other words</hi> of your own: Though we will not allow them to be <hi>necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y,</hi> because not in Scripture; (And we are more against ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding new Fundamental Articles of Faith to the Scripture, than against adding new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Forms or Ceremonies). But yet it will not serve: what is yet wanting? why, we must hold these words in a right sense! What? yet are not your own devised
<pb facs="tcp:61305:11"/> words a sufficient expression of the matter! When we have opened <hi>those words</hi> by <hi>other words,</hi> how will you know that we use those <hi>other words</hi> in a right sence, and <hi>so in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Our sence is, that <hi>Righteousness is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, that is, we are accounted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because for the Merits of Christs total fulfilling the Conditions of his Mediatorial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Father, by his Habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, his Actual Perfect Obedience, and his Sacrifice; or satisfactory Suffering for our sins in our stead, freely without any merit or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal act of mans, God hath made an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion and Deed of Gift, pardoning all sin, justifying and adopting and giving Right to the Spirit and Life eternally to every one that believingly accepteth Christ and the Gifts with and by and from him. And when we accept them they are all ours by virtue of this purchased Covenant-Gift.</hi> This is our short and plain explication. But yet this will not serve: Christianity is yet another thing. What is wanting? Why, we must say, that <hi>Christ was habitually and actually pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fectly Holy and Obedient, Imputatively in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons, and that each one of us did perfectly fulfil that Law which requireth perfect Habits and Acts in and by Christ impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and yet did also in and by him suffer our selves Imputatively for not fulfilling it▪ and</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61305:12"/>
                     <hi>Imputatively did our selves both satisfy God's Justice and merit Heaven; and that we have our selves Imputatively a Righteousness of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holiness and Obedience as sinless, and must be justified by the Law of Innocency, or Works, as having our selves imputatively ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it in Christ; And that this is our sole Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; and that Faith it self is not imputed to us for Righteousness; no not a meer particular subordinate Righteousness, answering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional part of the new Justifying Covenant, as necessary to our participation of Christ, and his freely given Righteousness.</hi> And must all this go into our Christianity! But where is it written? who devised it? was it in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creeds and Baptism? Or known in the Church for five thousand years from the Creation? I profess I take the Pope to be no more to be blamed for making a new Church-Government, than for making us so many new Articles of Faith: And I will not justifie those that Symbolize with him, or imitate him in either.</p>
                  <p>But yet many of the men that do this, are good men in other respects: and I love their <hi>zeal</hi> that doth all this evil, <hi>as it is for God</hi> and the <hi>honour of Jesus Christ,</hi> though I love it not as blind, nor their Errour or their Evil. But how hard is it to know what Spirit we are of! But it is the doleful
<pb facs="tcp:61305:12"/> mischief which their blind zeal doth, that maketh me speak; That three or four of them have made it their practice to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite my self, and tell People, <hi>He holdeth dangerous opinions; He is erroneous in the point of Justification. And his Books are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound and have dangerous Doctrines; He lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the old way of Justification, he favoureth Socinianism,</hi> and such-like: this is a small matter comparatively. Back-biting and <hi>false reports,</hi> are the ordinary fruits of <hi>bitter contentious Zeal,</hi> and the Spirit of a <hi>Sect</hi> as such doth usually so work (yea to confusion and every evil work,) when it hath banished the <hi>Zeal</hi> of Love and of Good Works. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. And I never counted it any great loss to their followers, that they disswade them from the reading of my writings (as the Papists do their Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes) as long as God hath blest our Land with so many better.</p>
                  <p>But there are other effects that command me once again to speak to them. 1. One is, that I have good proof of the lamentable Scandal of some very hopeful Persons of quality, who by hearing such language from these men, have bin ready to turn away from Religion, and say, If they thus set against and condemn one another, away with them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb facs="tcp:61305:13"/> 2. Because divers great Volumes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sad Evidence tells me that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented sence of Imputation, they have tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted many Learned men to deny Imputation of Christ's Righteousness absolutely, and bitterly revile it as a most Libertine Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But above all, that they do so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly confirm the Papists. I must profess that <hi>besides carnal Interest and the snare of ill Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> I do not think that there is any thing in the World that <hi>maketh or hardneth</hi> and <hi>confirmeth</hi> Papists more, and <hi>hindreth</hi> their reception of the Truth, than these same well-meaning people that are most zealous against them, by two means: 1. One by <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>unruliness</hi> in Church-respects, by which they perswade men, especially Rulers, that without such a Center as the Papacy, there will be no Union, and without such <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lence</hi> as theirs, there will be no Rule and Order. Thus one extreme doth breed and feed another. 2. The other is by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound sence of the Doctrine of <hi>Imputation of Christs Righteousness, (with an unsound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Faith)</hi> saying that every man is to believe it as Gods word (or <hi>side divinâ)</hi> that his own sins are pardoned; which when the Papists read (that, these men make it one of the chief Points of our difference from
<pb facs="tcp:61305:13"/>
                     <hi>Rome,)</hi> doth occasion them to triumph and reproach us, and confidently dissent from us in all the rest. I find in my self that my full certainty that they err in Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and some other points, doth greatly resolve me to neglect them at least, or suspect them in the rest which seem more dubious. And when the Papists find men most <hi>grosly erring</hi> in the very point where they lay the main stress of the difference, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect otherwise, but that this should make them despise and cast away our Books, and take us as men self-condemned and already vanquished, and dispute with us with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice as we do with an <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Socinian?</hi> They themselves that cast away <hi>our Books</hi> because <hi>they dissent from us,</hi> may feel in themselves what the <hi>Papists</hi> are like to do on this temptation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And it is not to be disregarded, that many private persons not studied in these points, are led away by the Authority of these men (for more than <hi>Papists</hi> believe as the Church believeth) to speak evil of the Truth, and sinfully to Backbite and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those Teachers, whom they hear others slander: and to speak evil of the things which they know not. And to see Gods own Servants seduced into <hi>Disaffection</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> and <hi>false Speeches</hi> against those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb facs="tcp:61305:14"/> that do most clearly tell them the truth, is a thing not silently to be cherished by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are valuers of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, and of the <hi>Truth</hi> and their <hi>Brethrens Souls,</hi> and that are displeased with that which the Devil is most pleased and God displeased with. These are my Reasons, submitted to every Readers Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; which may be as various as their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, Interests or Prejudices.</p>
                  <p>My Arguments in the third Chapter I have but briefly and hastily mentioned, as dealing with the lovers of naked Truth, who will not refuse it when they see it in its self-evidence. But they that desire larger proof, may find enough in Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconcil.</hi> and in <hi>John Goodwin</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> (If they can read him without prejudice). From whom yet I differ in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cause of our Justification, and take in the habitual and actual Holiness of Christ as well as his Sufferings, and equal in Merits; and think that <hi>pardon it self</hi> is <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by his <hi>Obedience</hi> as well as by his <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> To say nothing of some of his too harsh expressions, about the Imputation of Faith, and non-imputation of Christs Obedience, which yet in some explications he mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and sheweth that his sence is the same with theirs that place all our Righteousness
<pb facs="tcp:61305:14"/> in remission of Sin; such as (besides those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mentioned) are <hi>Musculus, Chamier,</hi> and abundance more: And when one saith that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>taken</hi> properly, and another that it is taken Relatively in Imputation, they seem to mean the same thing: For Faith properly taken is essentiated by its <hi>Object;</hi> And what <hi>Christ's</hi> Office is, and what <hi>Faith's</hi> Office is, I find almost all Protestants are agreed in sence, while they differ in the manner of expression, except there be a real difference in this point <hi>of simple Personating us in his perfect Holiness,</hi> and making the <hi>Person of a Mediator</hi> to contain <hi>essentially in sensu Civili the very Person of every elect sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and every such one to have verily been and done, in sensu civili, what Christ was and did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I much marvel to find that with most the Imputation of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is said to be for <hi>Remission of the penalty,</hi> and Imputation of <hi>perfect Holiness</hi> for the obtaining of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eternal Life;</hi> and yet that the far greater part of them that go that way say, that <hi>Imputation of all Christs Righteousness goeth first as the Cause, and Remission of Sin followeth as the Effect:</hi> So even Mr. <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> pag. 55. and others. Which seemeth to me to have this Sence, as if God said to a Believer, <hi>[I do repute thee to have perfectly fulfilled the Law in Christ, and so to be no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61305:15"/>
                     <hi>and therefore forgive thee all thy sin.]</hi> In our sence it is true and runs but thus <hi>[I do repute Christ to have been perfectly just habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actually in the Person of a Mediator in the Nature of Man, and to have suffered as if he had been a sinner, in the Person of a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, by his own Consent, and that in the very place, and stead of sinners;</hi> and by this to have satisfyed my Justice, and by both to have merited free <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> to be <hi>given by the new Covenant to all Believers: And thou being a Believer, I do repute thee justified and adopted by this satisfactory and meritorious Righteousness of Christ, and by this free Covenant-Gift, as verily and surely as if thou hadst done it and suffered thy self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my own part I find by experience, that almost all Christians that I talk with of it, have just this very notion of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which I have expressed, till some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Disputer by way of Controversie hath thrust the other notion into their mind. And for peace-sake I will say again, what I have elsewhere said, that I cannot think but that almost all Protestants agree in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this point of Justification (though some having not Acuteness enough to form their <hi>Notions</hi> of it rightly, nor Humility e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to suspect their Understandings, wrangle about <hi>Words,</hi> supposing it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:61305:15"/> the <hi>Matter);</hi> Because I find that all are agreed, 1. That no Elect Person is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified or Righteous by Imputation while he is an Infidel or Ungodly (except three or four that speak confusedly, and support the <hi>Antinomians)</hi> 2. That God doth not repute us to have done what Christ did in our <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al natural Persons Physically:</hi> The Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is about a <hi>Civil personating.</hi> 3. That God judgeth not falsly. 4. That Christ was not our Delegate and Instrument sent by us to do this in our stead, as a man payeth his debt by a Servant whom he sendeth with the money. 5. That therefore Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is not Imputed to us, as if we had done it by him as our Instrument. 6. That all the fruits of Christs Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are not ours upon our first believing (much less before). But we receive them by degrees: we have new pardon daily of new sins: We bear castigatory punishments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Death and Denials, or loss of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter assistance of the Spirit: Our Grace is all imperfect, &amp;c. 7. That we are under a Law (and not left ungoverned and lawless) and that Christ is our King and Judge: And this Law is the Law or Covenant of Grace, containing, besides the Precepts of perfect Obedience to the Law natural and superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a <hi>Gift of Christ with Pardon and Life;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61305:16"/> but only on Condition that we thankfully and believingly <hi>accept the Gift;</hi> And threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning non-liberation, and a far sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to all that unbelievingly and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reject it. 8. That therefore this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament or Covenant-Gift is God's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which he giveth us our Right to Christ and Pardon and Life: And no man hath such Right but by this Testament-Gift. 9. That this, (called a Testament, <hi>Covenant, Promise, and Law</hi> in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects) doth, besides the Conditions of our first Right, impose on us Continuance in the Faith, with sincere Holiness, as the necessary Condition of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Justification, and our actual Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And that Heaven is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this keeping of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as to the <hi>order of Gods Collation,</hi> though as to the <hi>value</hi> of the Benefit, it is a <hi>Free Gift,</hi> purchased, merited and given by Christ. 10. That we shall all be judged by this Law of Christ. 11. That we shall all be judged according to our deeds; and those that have done good (not according to the Law of Innocency or Works, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of Grace) shall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and those that have done evil (not by meer sin as sin against the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) but by not keeping the Conditions
<pb facs="tcp:61305:16"/> of the Law of Grace, shall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting punishment. The sober reading of these following texts may end all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with men that dare not grosly make void the Word of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 13. 22. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 23.) 12. That to be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the day of Judgment, is, to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to Life Eternal, and not condemned to Hell.</hi> And therefore to be the cause or condition that we are <hi>Judged to Glory,</hi> and the Cause or Condition that we are <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> then, will be all one. 13. That to be <hi>Judged</hi> according to our deeds, is to be <hi>Justified</hi> or <hi>Condemned</hi> according to them. 14. That the great tryal of that day (as I have after said) will not be, whether Christ hath done his part, but whether we have part in him, and so whether we have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and performed the Condition of that Covenant which giveth Christ and Life. 15. That the whole scope of Christ's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and all the Gospel, calleth us from sin, on the motive of avoiding Hell, (after we are reputed Righteous) and calleth us to Holiness, Perseverance and overcoming, on the motive of laying up a good Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having a Treasure in Heaven, and getting the Crown of Righteousness. 16. That the after-sins of men imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deserve Hell, or at least temporal
<pb facs="tcp:61305:17"/> punishments, and abatements of Grace and Glory. 17. That after such sins, especially hainous, we must pray for Pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that we may be pardoned, (and not say I fulfilled the Law in Christ as from my birth to my death, and therefore have no more need of Pardon.) 18. That he that saith he hath no sin, deceiveth himself, and is a lyar. 19. That Magistrates must pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sin as God's Officers; and Pastors by Censure in Christs name; and Parents also in their Children. 20. That if Christs <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> and Satisfaction and Merit, had bin <hi>Ours</hi> in <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> as it was <hi>his own,</hi> we could have no <hi>Guilt, no</hi> need of <hi>Pardon,</hi> no suspension or detention of the proper fruits of it, no punishment for sin, (specially not so great as the with-holding of degrees of Grace and Glory); And many of the consequents aforesaid could not have followed.</p>
                  <p>All this I think we are all agreed on; and none of it can with any face be denied by a Christian. And if so; 1. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christs <hi>perfect Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings, Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> be all given us, and imputed unto us at our first believing as <hi>Our own</hi> in the very thing it self, by a full and proper <hi>Title</hi> to the thing:
<pb facs="tcp:61305:17"/> Or only so <hi>imputed to us,</hi> as to be <hi>judged a just cause of giving us all the effects in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and time forementioned as God pleaseth,</hi> let all judge as evidence shall convince them. 2. And then, whether they do well that thrust their devised sence on the Churches as an Article of Faith, let the more impartial judge.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with this confession to the Reader, that though the matter of these Papers hath been thought on these thirty years, yet the Script is <hi>hasty,</hi> and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in order and fulness; I could not have leisure so much as to affix in the margin all the texts which say what I assert: And seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, especially the state of the Case, are oft repeated. But that is, lest once read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffice not to make them observed and understood; which if many times will do, I have my end. If any say, that I should take time to do things more accurately, I tell him that I know my straights of time, and quantity of business better than he doth; and I will rather be defective in the mode of one work, than leave undone the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of another as great.</p>

                     <p>Whether we are Reputed personally to have suffered on the Cross, and to have satisfied God's Justice for our own sins, and to have been habitually perfectly Holy, and Actually perfectly Obedient, in Christ, or by Christ, and so to have merited our own Justification and Salvation.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have said so much of this subject already in my Confession, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in my Disputations of Justification, and in my Life of Faith that I thought not to have meddled with it any more; But some occasions tell me that it is not yet needless, though those that have most need will not read it.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The History of the Controversie.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>§ 1. IN the Gospel it self we have first <hi>Christ's Doctrine delivered by his own mouth.</hi> And in that there is so little said of this Subject that I find few that will pretend thence to resolve the Controversie, for Imputation in the rigorous sence. The same I say of the Acts of the Apostles, and all the rest of the New Testament, except <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> having to do with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who could not digest the equalizing of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with them, and specially with the factious Jewish Christians, who thought the <hi>Gentiles</hi> must become <hi>Proselytes</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> as well as to Christ, if they would be Justified and Saved, at large confuteth this opinion, and freeth the Consciences of the Gentile Christians from the Imposition of this yoke (as also did all the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.) And in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61305:20"/> proveth that the Mosaical Law is so far from being necessary to the Justification of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Godly <hi>Jews</hi> themselves were not Justified by it, but by <hi>Faith;</hi> And that by the <hi>works of it</hi> (and consequently not by the works of the Law or Covenant of Innocency, which no man ever kept) no man could ever be justified: And therefore that they were to look for Justification by Christ alone, and by Faith in him, or by meer Christianity; which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Partition-wall being taken down. This briefly is the true scope of <hi>Paul</hi> in these Controversies.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. But in <hi>Paul's</hi> own days, there were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in his Epistles which the unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable did wrest, as they did the other Scriptures, to their own destruction, as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. And it seemeth by the Epistle of <hi>James,</hi> that this was part of it: For he is fain there earnestly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against some, who thought that Faith without Christian works themselves, would justifie, and flatly affirmeth, that we are <hi>Justified by Works, and not by Faith only;</hi> that is, as it is a <hi>Practical Faith,</hi> in which is contained a <hi>Consent</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> to <hi>obey,</hi> which first putteth us into a justified state; so it is that <hi>Practical Faith actually working by Love,</hi> and the <hi>actual performance</hi> of our <hi>Covenant,</hi> which by <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> to our <hi>Justification,</hi> as <hi>Continued</hi> and as <hi>Consummate by the Sentence of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Against which sentence of <hi>James</hi> there is not a syllable to be found in <hi>Paul.</hi> But all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreeth that <hi>all men shall be Judged,</hi> that is, <hi>Justified</hi> or <hi>Condemned, according to their works.</hi> But it is not this Controversie (between <hi>Faith and</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61305:21"/>
                        <hi>Works)</hi> which I am now to speak to, having done it enough heretofore.</p>
                     <p>§ 3. From the days of the Apostles till <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> this Controversie was little meddled with: For the truth is, the Pastors and Doctors took not Christianity in those days for a matter of Shcolastick subtilty, but of plain <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> And contented themselves to say that Christ dyed for our sins, and that we are Justified by Faith; and that Christ was made unto us Righteousness, as he was made to us Wisdom, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. But withal those three first Ages were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon Holiness of Life, as that they addicted their Doctrine, their Zeal, and their constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to it: And particularly to great austerities to their Bodies, in great Fastings, and great contempt of the World, and exercises of Mortification, to kill their fleshly Lusts, and deny their Wills, and Worldly Interests; to which end at last they got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wildernesses, and Monasteries, where, in Fasting and Prayer, and a single life, they might live as it were out of the World, while they were in it; (Though indeed <hi>persecution</hi> first drove them thither to save themselves.) Into these Deserts and Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries those went that had most Zeal, but not usually most <hi>Knowledg:</hi> And they turned much of their Doctrine and discourses about these Austerities, and about the practices of a Godly Life, and about all the Miracles which were (some really) done, and (some feigned) by credulous soft people said to be done among them. So that in all these ages most of their writings are taken up, 1. In defending Christianity against the Heathens, which was the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61305:21"/> work of the Learned Doctors. 2. And in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting swarms of Heresies that sprung up. 3. And in matters of Church-order, and Ecclesiastical and Monastical discipline. 4. And in the precepts of a Godly Life: But the point of Imputation was not only not meddled with distinctly, but almost all the Writers of those times, seem to give very much to <hi>Mans free-will,</hi> and to <hi>works of Holiness,</hi> and <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> making too rare and obscure mention of the distinct Interests of Christs Merits in our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at least, with any touch upon this Controversie: Yet generally holding <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> only by Christs Sacrifice and Merits; though they <hi>spake</hi> most of <hi>Mans Holiness,</hi> when they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men to seek to make sure of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>§ 5. And indeed at the day of Judgment, the Question to be decided, will not be, Whether Christ dyed and did his part, but, Whether we believed and obeyed him and did our part: Not, Whether Christ performed his Covenant with the Father; but, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we performed our Covenant with him: For it is not Christ that is to be judged, <hi>but we by Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 6. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> disputing about the Power of Nature and Freewill and the Grace of Christ, began to make it a matter of great Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> speaketh) to be a Christian. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> (a <hi>Brittain,</hi> of great wit, and continence, and a good and sober life, as <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>Epist.</hi> 120.) stifly defended the Power of Nature and Freewill, and made Grace to consist only in the free Pardon of all sin through Christ, and in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Perswasions</hi> only to a holy life for the time to come, with Gods common ordinary help. <hi>Augustine</hi> copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61305:22"/> (and justly) defended God's special eternal Election of some, and his special Grace given them to make them repent and believe, and presevere: (For though he maintained that some that were true Believers, Lovers of God, Justified and in a state of Salvation, did fall away and perish, yet he held that none of the <hi>Elect</hi> did fall <hi>away and perish;</hi> And he maintained that even the Justified that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, had their Faith by a special Grace above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.) <hi>Vid. August. de bono Persever. Cap.</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; de Cor. &amp; Grat. Cap.</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>alibi passim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 7. In this their Controversie, the point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification fell into frequent debate: But no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie ever arose between them, <hi>Whether Christ's personal Righteousness considered Materially or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> was by Imputation made ours as Proprietors of the thing it self, distinct from its effects; or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God reputed us to have satisfied and also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed in Christ. For <hi>Augustine</hi> himself, while he vehemently defendeth free Grace, speaketh too little even of the Pardon of sin: And though he say, that <hi>Free Pardon</hi> of sins is part of Grace, yet he maketh <hi>Justification</hi> to be that which we call San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, that makes us inherently Righteous or new-Creatures, by the operation of the Holy Ghost: And he thinketh that this is the Justification which <hi>Paul</hi> pleadeth to be of Grace and not of works; yet including <hi>Pardon of sin,</hi> and confessing that <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> to Justifie, signifieth in Scripture, not to make just, but to <hi>judg just.</hi> And though in it self this be but <hi>de nomine,</hi> and not <hi>de re;</hi> yet, 1. no doubt but as to many texts of Scripture <hi>Austin</hi> was mistaken, though some few texts <hi>Beza</hi> and others confess to be taken in his sence: 2. And the exposition of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61305:22"/> many texts lieth upon it. But he that took Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be by the operation of the Holy Ghost giving us Love to God, could not take it to be by Imputation in the rigorous sence no question; nor doth <hi>de re.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 8. But because, as some that, it seems, never read <hi>Augustine,</hi> or understood not plain words, have nevertheless ventured confidently to deny what I have said of his Judgment in the points of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (in my Tract of Perseverance) so, it's like such men will have no more wariness what they say in the point of Justification; I will cite a few of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin's</hi> words among many, to show what he took Justification to be, though I differ from him <hi>de nomine</hi>

Sed sic intelligendum est, factores Legis justificabuntur, ut sciamus eos non esse factores legis nisi justificentur; ut non justificatio factoribus accedat, sed factores legis justificatio precedat: Quid est enim aliud Justificati, quam Justi facti, ab illo scilicet qui justificat Impium, ut ex impio fiat justus?—Aut certe ita dictum est, Justificabuntur, ac si diceretur Justi habebuntur, justi deputabuntur.</hi>

                     <p>Abundance such passages in <hi>Augustine</hi> fully shew that he took Justification to signifie Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Spirits renovation of us; and thinks it is called the Righteousness of God and Christ, and not ours, because by the Spirit he worketh it in us.

                     <p>§ 9. The Schoolmen being led by the Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick wit of <hi>Augustine,</hi> fell into the same phrase of speech and opinions, <hi>Lombard</hi> making <hi>Augustine</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61305:24"/> his Master, and the rest making him theirs, till some began to look more towards the Semipelagian way.</p>
                     <p>§ 10. And when Church-Tyranny and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, had obscured the Christian Light, the true sence of Justification by the Righteousness of Christ, was much obscured with the rest, and a world of humane inventions under the name of Good works, were brought in to take up the peoples minds; And the merits of man, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> sounded louder than the merits of Christ, in too many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And the people that were ignorant of the true Justification, were filled with the noise of Pardons, Indulgences, Satisfactions, Penances, Pilgrimages, and such like.</p>
                     <p>§ 11. <hi>Luther</hi> finding the Church in this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and woful state, where he lived, did labour to reduce mens minds and trust, from humane foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and merits, and indulgences, to Christ, and to help them to the Knowledg of true Righteousness: But according to his temper in the heat of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he sometimes let fall some words which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainly to make Christs own personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it self to be every Believers own by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our sins to be verily Christs own sins in themselves by Imputation: Though by many other words he sheweth that he meant only, that our sins were Christs in <hi>the effects</hi> and not in themselves, and Christs personal Righteousness ours in the effects and not in it self.</p>
                     <p>§ 12. But his Book on the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and some other words, gave occasion to the errours of some then called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and afterward <hi>Libertines</hi> (when some additions were made to their errours.) Of these <hi>Islebius Agricola</hi> was the chief: Whom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61305:25"/>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> confuted and reduced, better expounding his own words: But <hi>Islebius</hi> ere long turned back to the Contrary extreme of Popery, and with <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Julius Pflug,</hi> (three Popish Bishops made for that purpose) promoted the Emperours <hi>Interim</hi> to the persecution of the Protestants.</p>
                     <p>§ 13. The Protestant Reformers themselves spake variously of this subject. Most of them rightly asserted that Christ's Righteousness was ours by the way of Meriting our Righteousness, which was therefore said to be Imputed to us. Some of them follow'd <hi>Luthers</hi> first words, and said that Christs sufferings and all his personal Righteousness was Imputed to us, so as to be ours in it self, and when judged as if we had personally done what he did, and were righteous with the same Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that he was.</p>
                     <p>§ 14. <hi>Ambsdorsius, Gallus,</hi> and some other hot <hi>Lutherans</hi> were so jealous of the <hi>name</hi> of works, that they maintained that good works were not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation. (Yea as to Salvation some called them hurtful:) And <hi>Georgius Major</hi> a Learned so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Divine was numbered by them among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> for maintaining that Good works were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation; as you may see in the perverse writings of <hi>Chlusseburgius</hi> and many others.</p>
                     <p>§ 15. <hi>Andreas Osiander</hi> (otherwise a Learned Protestant) took up the opinion, that we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the very essential Righteousness of God himself. But he had few followers.</p>
                     <p>§ 16. The Papists fastening upon those Divines who held Imputation of Christs personal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in it self in the rigid sence, did hereupon greatly insult against the Protestants, as if it had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61305:25"/> been their common doctrine, and it greatly stopt the Reformation: For many seeing that some made that a Fundamental in our difference, and <hi>articulus stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> and seeing how easily it was disproved, how fully it was against the Doctrine of all the ancient Church, and what intolerable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences followed, did judge by that of the rest of our Doctrine, and were settledly hardened against all.</p>
                     <p>§ 17. The Learned Divines of <hi>Germany</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, fell to a fresh review of the Controversie, and after a while abundance of very Learned Godly Doctors fell to distinguish between the Active and Passive Righteousness of Christ; and not accurately distinguishing of Imputation, because they perceived that Christ suffered in our stead, in a fuller sense than he could be said to be <hi>Holy</hi> in our stead, or fulfil the Law in our stead. Hereupon they principally mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Controversie, as about the sort of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness Imputed to us: And a great number of the most Learned famous Godly Divines of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, maintained that Christ's Passive Righteousness was Imputed to us, even his whole Humiliation or Suffering, by which the pardon of all sins of Commission and Omission was procured for us; but that his <hi>Active Righteousness</hi> was not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, though it profited us; but was <hi>Justitia Personae</hi> to make Christ a fit Sacrifice for our sins, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none of his own, but the Suffering was his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia Meriti.</hi> His Obedience they said was performed <hi>nostro bono, non nostro loco,</hi> for our good but not in our stead; but his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> both <hi>nostro bono &amp; loco,</hi> both <hi>for our good</hi> and in <hi>our stead:</hi> but neither of them so strictly <hi>in nostrâ Personâ</hi> in our Person, as if we did it by and in Christ. The Writers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61305:26"/> this were <hi>Cargius,</hi> and that holy man <hi>Olevian</hi> and <hi>Ʋrsine,</hi> and <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>Scultetus,</hi> and <hi>Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Alstedius, Wendeline, Beckman,</hi> and many more. He that will see the sum of their arguings may read it in <hi>Wendeline's Theolog. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. and in <hi>Paraeus</hi> his <hi>Miscellanies</hi> after <hi>Ʋrsine's Corpus The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olog.</hi> After them <hi>Camero</hi> with his Learned follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers took it up in France. <hi>Leg.

So that at that time (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> tells you) there were four opinions: some thought Christ's Passive Righteousness only was Imputed to us; some also his <hi>Active</hi> instead of our Actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; some also his <hi>Habitual</hi> instead of our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual perfection; And some thought also his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Righteousness was Imputed to us, because of our Union with Christ, God and Man. (Imputed I say; for I now speak not of <hi>Osiander's</hi> opinion of Inhesion.) And <hi>Lubbertus</hi> wrote a Conciliatory Tractate favouring those that were for the Passive part. And <hi>Forbes</hi> hath written for the Passive only imputed. <hi>Molinaeus</hi> casteth away the distinction, <hi>Thes. Sedan. v.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 625. § 18.</p>
                     <p>§ 18. In England most Divines used the phrase, that we were Justified by the forgiveness of sin and the Imputation of Christs Righteousness, and being accepted as Righteous unto life thereon: But the sense of Imputation few pretended accurately to discuss. <hi>Davenant</hi> who dealt most claborately in it, and maintaineth Imputation stiflly in terms; yet when he telleth you what Protestants mean by it, saith, that <hi>[Possunt nobis imputari, non solum nostrae possiones, actiones, qualitates, sed etiam extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seca quaedam, quae nec a nobis fluunt, nec in nobis hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61305:26"/>
                        <hi>De facto autem Imputantur, quando illorum intuitus &amp; respectus valent nobis ad aliquem effectum, aeque ac si a nobis aut in nobis essent.</hi> (Note, that he saith, but <hi>ad aliquem effectum, non ad omn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m.)</hi> And he instanceth in one that is a <hi>slothful fellow himself, but is advanced to the Kings Favour and Nobility for some great Service done by his Progenitors to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi> And in <hi>one that deserving death is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned through the Intercession of a friend, or upon some suffering in his stead which the King imposeth on his Friend.</hi> This is the Imputation which <hi>Davenant</hi> and other such Protestants plead for; which I think is not to be denied. Were it not for length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the discourse and wearying the Reader, I would cite many other of our greatest Divines, who plead for the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, that <hi>Davenant</hi> here expoundeth himself.</p>
                     <p>But some less judicious grating upon a harsh and unsound sence, Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> a very Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Godly Divine of <hi>London,</hi> wrote a <hi>Latine</hi> Treatise <hi>de Reconciliatione,</hi> one of the Learnedst that hath ever been written of that subject, in which he laboureth to disprove the rigid Imputation of Christs Holiness and Obedience to man; and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is Righteous to whom all sin of Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Commission is forgiven; and confuteth these three Assertions. 1. That <hi>A Sinner is Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have fulfilled the Law in and by Christ.</hi> 2. <hi>And being reputed to have fulfilled the Law, is taken for formally just as a fulfiller of it.</hi> 3. <hi>And being formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly just as a fullfiller of the Law, Life eternal is due to him by that Covenant,</hi> that saith, <hi>do this and live.</hi> Vid. Part. 2. li. 1. Cap. 11. pag. 152. <hi>Cum sequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi> Thus and much further <hi>Mr. Wotton</hi> went to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61305:27"/> the very quick of the Controversie, and irrefragably overthrew the rigid Imputation.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>William Bradshaw,</hi> a Learned Godly Nonconformist, being grieved at the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Active and Passive Righteousness, and thinking that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> denied all Imputation of the Active Righteousness (which he did not, but owneth it to be Imputed as a meritorious Cause:) Part. 2. li. 1. Cap. 13. pag. 165. <hi>Ne illud quidem negaverim, imputari nobis illius justitiam &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, ut ad nostrum fructum redundet: Id unum non concedo, Legem nos in Christo &amp; per Christum ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâsse, ut propter eam a nobis praestitam vita aeterna ex faedere, Hoc fac et vives, debeatur.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> I say attempted a Conciliatory middle way, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the same in the main with Mr. <hi>Wotton's:</hi> He honoureth the Learned Godly persons on each side, but maintaineth that the Active and Passive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness are both Imputed, but not in the rigid sence of Imputation denying both these Propositions. 1. <hi>That Christ by the Merits of his Passive Obedience only, hath freed us from the guilt of all sin, both Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Original, of Omission and Commission.</hi> 2. <hi>That in the Imputation of Christs Obedience both Active and Passive, God doth so behold and consider a sinner in Christ, as if the sinner himself had done and suffered th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>About that time the Doctrine of personal Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the rigid sence began to be fully improved in <hi>England,</hi> by the Sect of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> (trulyer called <hi>Libertines)</hi> of whom Dr. <hi>Crispe</hi> was the most eminent Ring-leader, whose books took wonderfully with ignorant Professors under the pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling Christ and free Grace. After him rose Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Simpson,</hi> and then Mr. <hi>Town,</hi> and at last in the Armies of the Parliament, <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> and so many more, as that it seemed to be likely to have carried most of the Professors in the Army, and abundance in the City and Country that way: But that suddenly (one Novelty being set up against another) the opinions called <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi> rose up against it, and gave it a check and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed many in the Army and City the clean contrary way: And these two Parties divided a great part of the raw injudicious sort of the professors between them, which usually are the greatest part: but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Army which was like to become a Law and example to others.</p>
                     <p>Before this <hi>John Goodwin</hi> (not yet turned <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian)</hi> preached and wrote with great diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Justification against the rigid sence of Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who being answered by Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robourough,</hi> with far inferiour strength, his book had the greater success for such answerers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> then swarming in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anthony Burges,</hi> a very worthy Divine was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61305:28"/> to Preach and Print against them; which he did in several books: but had he been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the men as I was, he would have found more need to have vindicated the Gospel against them than the Law.</p>
                     <p>Being daily conversant my self with the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Souldiers, and hearing their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contests, I thought it pitty that nothing but one extreme should be used to beat down that other, and I found the <hi>Antinomian</hi> party far the stronger, higher, and more fierce, and working towards grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter changes and subversions; And I found that they were just falling in with <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> that <hi>Christ hath repented and believed for us, and that we must no more question our Faith and Repentance, than Christ.</hi> This awakened me better to study these points; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, and not furnished with sufficient read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Controversie, and also being where were no libraries, I was put to study only the <hi>naked mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it self.</hi> Whereupon I shortly wrote a small book called <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of Justification, &amp;c. Which contained that Doctrine in substance which I judg sound; but being the first that I wrote, it had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral expressions in it which needed correction; which made me suspend or retract it till I had time to reform them. Mens judgments of it were various, some for it and some against it: I had before been a great esteemer of two books of one name, <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twisses,</hi> above most other books. And from them I had taken in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a double Justification, one <hi>in soro Dei</hi> as an Immanent eternal Act of God, and another <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> the Knowledg of that; and I knew no other: But now I saw, that neither of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61305:28"/> those was the Justification which the Scripture spake of. But some half<hi>-Antinomians</hi> which were for the Justification before Faith, which I wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, were most angry with my book. And Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> wrote against it, which I answered in an <hi>Apologie,</hi> and fullyer wrote my judgment in my <hi>Confession;</hi> and yet more fully in some Disputations of Justification against Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> who had in a book of Justification made some exceptions; and pag. 346. had defended that <hi>[As in Christ's suffering we were looked upon by God as suffering in him; so by Christs obeying of the Law, we were beheld as fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law in him.]</hi> To those Disputations I never had any answer. And since then in my <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> I have opened the <hi>Libertine</hi> errours about Justification, and stated the sence of Imputation.</p>
                     <p>Divers writers were then employed on these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Mr. <hi>Eyers</hi> for Justification before Faith (that is, of elect Infidels) and Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridg,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Warren</hi> against it. Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> wrote a considerable Book of Forgiveness of sin, defending the sounder way: Mr. <hi>George Hopkins,</hi> wrote to prove that Justification and Sanctification are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually carryed on together: Mr. <hi>Warton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Graile,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jessop,</hi> (clearing the sence of Dr. <hi>Twisse,)</hi> and many others wrote against <hi>Antinomianism.</hi> But no man more clearly opened the whole doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, than Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> Minister at <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> in a Sermon Printed in the <hi>Lectures</hi> at <hi>St. Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields.</hi> By such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours the before-prevailing <hi>Antinomianism</hi> was suddenly and somewhat marvelously suppressed, so that there was no great noise made by it.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61305:29"/> the two fore-described extremes; in short, <q rend="margQuotes">That <hi>we are Justified by Christ's whole Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Passive, Active,</hi> and <hi>Habitual,</hi> yea the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> so far included as by <hi>Ʋnion</hi> advancing the rest to a valuable sufficiency: That the Passive, that is, Christ's whole Humiliation is <hi>satisfactory</hi> first, and so meritorious, and the Active and Habitual meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious primarily. That as God the Father did appoint to Christ as Mediator his Duty for our Redemption by a Law or Covenant, so Christ's whole fulfilling that Law, or performance of his Covenant-Conditions as such (by Habitual and Actual perfection, and by Suffering) made up one Meritorious Cause of our Justification, not distinguishing with Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> of the pure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the servile part of Christ's Obedience, save only as one is more a part of Humiliation than the other, but in point of Merit taking in all: That as Christ suffered in our stead that we might not suffer, and obeyed in our nature, that perfection of Obedience might not be necessary to our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> and this in the person of a Mediator and Sponsor for us sinners, but not so in our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> as that we truely in a moral or civil sence, did all this in and by him; Even so God repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the thing to be as it is, and so far Imputeth Christ's Righteousness and Merits and Satisfaction to us, as that it is Reputed by him the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cause of our Justification; and that for it God maketh a Covenant of Grace, in which he freely giveth Christ, Pardon and Life to all that accept the Gift as it is; so that the Accepters are by this Covenant or Gift as surely justified and saved by Christ's Righteousness as if they had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61305:29"/> Obeyed and Satisfied themselves. Not that Christ meriteth that we shall have Grace to fulfil the Law our selves and stand before God in a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of our own, which will answer the Law of works and justifie us: But that the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gift in the Covenant of Grace being performed by every penitent Believer, that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> doth <hi>pardon</hi> all <hi>their sins</hi> (as Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and giveth them a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Life eternal, for Christs Merits.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the sence of Imputation which I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers asserted as the true healing middle way. And as bad as they are, among the most Learned Papists, <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Lapide</hi> is cited by Mr. <hi>Wotton, Vasquez</hi> by <hi>Davenant, Suarez</hi> by Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> as speaking for some such Imputation, and Merit: <hi>Grotius de Satisf.</hi> is clear for it.</p>
                     <p>But the Brethren called Congregational or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant in their Meeting at the <hi>Savoy, Oct.</hi> 12. 1658. publishing a Declaration of their Faith, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. have these words <hi>[Those whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth; not by infusing Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as Righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christs sake alone: not by imputing Faith it self, the act of believing, or any other evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, as their Righteousness; but by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christs Active Obedience to the whole Law, and Passive Obedience in his death, for their whole and sole Righteousness; they receiving and resting on him and his Righteousness by Faith.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the publication of this it was variously spoken of: some thought that it gave the <hi>Papists</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61305:30"/> so great a scandal, and advantage to reproach the <hi>Protestants</hi> as denying all inherent Righteousness, that it was necessary that we should disclaim it: Others said that it was not their meaning to deny Inherent Righteousness, though their words so spake, but only that we are not justified by it: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny said that it was not the work of all of that party, but of some few that had an inclination to some of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> principles, out of a mistaken zeal of free Grace; and that it is well known that they differ from us, and therefore it cannot be imputed to us, and that it is best make no stir about it, lest it irritate them to make the matter worse by a Defence, &amp; give the Papists too soon notice of it. And I spake with one Godly Minister that was of their Assembly, who told me, that they did not subscribe it, and that they meant but to deny Justification by inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. And though such men in the Articles of their declared Faith, no doubt can speak intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and aptly, and are to be understood as they speak according to the common use of the words; yet even able-men sometimes may be in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when eager engagement in an opinion and parties, carryeth them too precipitantly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them forget something, that should be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. The Sentences here which we excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst are these two. But the first was not much offensive because their meaning was right; <hi>And the same words are in the Assemblies Confession, though they might better have been left out.</hi>

                        <p> Our opinion is, 1. That it is better to justifie and expound the Scripture, than flatly to deny it: If Scripture so oft say, that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>reckoned</hi> or <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for <hi>Righteousness,</hi> it becometh not Christians, to say, <hi>It is not:</hi> But to shew in what sence it is, and in what it is not. For if it be so Imputed in <hi>no sence,</hi> the Scripture is made false: If in any sence it should not be universally denied but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We hold, that in Justification there is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, 1. The Purchasing and Meritorious Cause of Justification freely given in the new Covenant. This is only Christ's Sufferings and Righteousness, and so it is Reputed of God, and Imputed to us. 2. The <hi>Order of Donation,</hi> which is, On <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Acceptance;</hi> And so 3. The Condition of our <hi>Title</hi> to the free Gift by this Covenant; And that is, Our Faith, or Acceptance of the Gift ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its nature and use.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61305:32"/> That we are Justified by more sorts of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than one, in several respects. We are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>only by Christs Righteousness</hi> as the Purchasing and Meritorious Cause of our Justification freely given by that new Covenant. We are Justified by the Righteousness of God the Father, as performing his Covenant with Christ and us, (efficiently). We are justified efficiently by the Righteousness of Christ as our Judg, passing a just sentence according to his Covenant: These last are neither <hi>Ours</hi> nor Imputed to us: But we are justified also against the Accusation, of being finally Impenitent Unbelievers or unholy, by the personal particular Righteousness of our own Repentance, <hi>Faith and Holiness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For 2. We say, that there is an universal Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Righteousness, and there is a particular one. And this <hi>particular</hi> one may be the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of our Title to all the rest. And this is our case. The Day of Judgment is not to try and <hi>Judg Christ,</hi> or <hi>his Merits, but us:</hi> He will judg us himself by his new Law or Covenant, the sum of which is, <hi>[Except ye Repent, ye shall all perish: and, He that believeth, shall be saved: and he that believeth not, shall be condemned.</hi> If we be not accused of <hi>Impenitence</hi> or <hi>Ʋnbelief,</hi> but only of <hi>not-fulfilling the Law of Innocency,</hi> that will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we are to be <hi>tryed</hi> only by <hi>that Law,</hi> which is not true: And then we <hi>refer the Accuser only to Christ's Righteousness,</hi> and to the <hi>Pardoning Law of Grace,</hi> and to nothing in our selves to answer that charge; And so it would be <hi>Christ's part</hi> only that would be judged. But <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and all the Scripture assureth us of the contrary, that it's <hi>Our part that it is to be tryed</hi> and <hi>judged,</hi> and that we
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61305:33"/> shall be all judged according to what we have done. And no man is in danger there of any other accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, but that he did not truly <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> and live <hi>a holy life to Christ:</hi> And shall the <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believer</hi> say, <hi>I did never Repent and Believe, but Christ did it for me;</hi> and so use <hi>two Lyes,</hi> one of Christ, and another of himself, that he may be justified? Or shall the <hi>Ʋnholy, Impenitent Infidel</hi> say, It's true I was never a <hi>Penitent Believer, or holy,</hi> but Christ was for me, or Christs Righteousness is my sole Righteousness? that is a fashood; For Christs Righteousness is none of his. So that there is a <hi>particular personal Righteousness,</hi> consisting in <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> which by way of <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of our title to Christ and his Gift of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Life, is of absolute necessity in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. Therefore Imputed Righteousness is not the <hi>sole Righteousness</hi> which must justifie us.</p>
                        <p>I cited abundance of plain Texts to this purpose in my Confession, pag. 57. &amp;c. Of which book I add, that when it was in the press, I procured those three persons whom I most highly valued for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> (whose last work it was in this World) Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and lastly Arch-Bishop <hi>Ʋsher</hi> to read it over, except the Epistles (Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> read only to <hi>pag.</hi> 163.) and no one of them advised me to alter one word, nor signified their dissent to any word of it. But I have been long on this: to proceed in the History.—</p>
                        <p>The same year that I wrote that book, that most Judicious excellent man <hi>Joshua Placaeus</hi> of <hi>Saumours</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was exercised in a Controversie conjunct with this; How far <hi>Adams</hi> sin is imputed to us. And to speak truth, at first in the <hi>Theses Salmuriens.</hi>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61305:33"/>
                           <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. he seemed plainly to dispute against the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Adam's</hi> actual sin, and his arguments I elsewhere answer.) And <hi>Andr. Rivet</hi> wrote a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Judgment of all sorts of Divines for the contrary. But after he vindicated himself, &amp; shewed that his Doctrine was, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>fact</hi> is not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> imputed to each of us, as if our <hi>persons</hi> as <hi>persons</hi> had been all fully represented in <hi>Adam's</hi> person (by an arbitrary Law or Will of God) or reputed so to be: But that our Persons being <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> or <hi>Seminally</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> we derive from him first our <hi>Persons,</hi> and in them a corrupted nature, and that nature corrupted and justly deserted by the Spirit of God, because it is derived from <hi>Adam</hi> that so sinned: And so that <hi>Adams</hi> fact is imputed to us mediately, <hi>mediante natura &amp; Corruptione,</hi> but not primarily and immediately.</p>
                        <p>This doctrine of the Good and Judicious man was thought too new to escape sharp censures, so that a rumour was spread abroad that he denied all Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> fact, and placed original guilt only in the Guilt of Coruption, for which indeed he gave occasion. A Synod being called at <hi>Charenton,</hi> this opinion without naming any Author was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; &amp; all Ministers required to subscribe it: <hi>Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> being of <hi>Placeus</hi> mind, in a speech of two hours vindicated his opinion. <hi>Placeus</hi> knowing that the Decree did not touch him, took no notice of it.

                        <p> For my part I confess that I am not satisfied in his distinction of <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> I see not, but our <hi>Persons</hi> as derived from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> being supposed to be in Being, we are at once Reputed to be such as Virtually sinned in him, and such as are deprived of God's Image. And if either must be put first, me-thinks it should rather be the former, we being therefore deprived of God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (not by God, but by <hi>Adam)</hi> because he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it away from himself. It satisfieth me much more, to distinguish of our <hi>Being</hi> and so <hi>sinning</hi> in <hi>Adam Personally</hi> and <hi>Seminally,</hi> or <hi>Virtually:</hi> we were not <hi>Persons</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> when he sinned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did not so sin in him: And it is a fiction added to God's Word, to say that God (because he would do it) reputed us to be what we were not. But we were Seminally in <hi>Adam</hi> as in <hi>Causâ natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,</hi> who was to produce us out of his very essence: And therefore that kind of being which we had in him, could not be innocent when he was guilty: And when we had our <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> from him, we are justly reputed to be as we are, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of one that actually sinned: And so when our <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Personality</hi> maketh us capable Subjects, we are guilty <hi>Persons</hi> of his sin; though not with so <hi>plenary a sort of Guilt as he.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I fear not to say, that as I lay the ground of this Imputation in Nature it self, so I doubt not but I have elsewhere proved that there is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of all Children in the guilt of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents sins by nature, than is sufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged or lamented by most, though Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with the proof of it: And that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking it, and laying all upon God's arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61305:34"/> and Imputation, is the great temptation to <hi>Pelagians</hi> to deny Original sin: And that our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery no more increaseth by it, is, because we are now under a Covenant that doth not so charge all culpability on mankind, as the Law of Innocency did alone. And there is something of Pardon in the Case. And the <hi>English Litany,</hi> (after <hi>Ezra, Daniel</hi> and others) well prayeth, Remember not, Lord, our offences, nor the offences of our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>This same <hi>Placeus</hi> in <hi>Thes. Salmuriens. Vol.</hi> 1. hath opened the doctrine of Justification so fully, that I think that one Disputation might spare some the reading of many contentious Volumes.</p>
                        <p>The rigid assertors of Imputation proved such a stumbling-block to many, that they run into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme, and not only denyed it, but vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loaded it with the Charges of over-throwing all Godliness and Obedience. Of these <hi>Parker</hi> (as is said) with some others wrote against it in an answer to the Assemblies Confession: Dr. <hi>Gell</hi> often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth it in a large Book in <hi>Folio.</hi> And lastly and most sharply and confidently <hi>Herbert Thorndike,</hi> (to mention no more.)</p>
                        <p>The History of this Controversie of Imputation, I conclude, though disorderly, with the sense of all the Christian Churches, in the Creeds and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Confessions, because they were too long to be fitly inserted by the way.</p>

The Augustane Confession, Art. 3, 4. <hi>Christ died—that he might reconcile the Father to us, and be a sacrifice, not only for original sin, but also for all the actual sins of men.—And that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain these benefits of Christ, that is, Remission of sins, justification and life eternal, Christ gave us the Gospel in which these benefits are propounded.—To preach</hi>

                           <hi>Repentance in his Name, and Remission of sins among all Nations. For when men propagated in the natural manner have sin, and cannot truly satisfie Gods Law, the Gospel reproveth sin, and sheweth us Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and so teacheth us about Pardon of sins—That freely for Christ's sake are given us, Remission of sins, &amp; Justification by Faith, by which we must confess that these are given us for Christ, who was made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us, and appeased the Father. Though the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel require Penitence; yet that pardon of sin may be sure, it teacheth us that it is freely given us; that is, that it dependeth not on the Condition of our worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor is given for any precedent works, or worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of following works.—For Conscience in true fears findeth no work which it can oppose to the Wrath of God; and Christ is proposed and given us, to be a propitiator. This honour of Christ must not be transferred to our works. Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>saith, ye are saved free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (or of Grace.) And it is of grace, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise might be sure; that is, Pardon will be sure; when we know that it dependeth not on the Condition of our worthiness, but is given for Christ.—In the Creed this Article [I believe the Forgiveness of sins,] is added to the history: And the rest of the history of Christ must be referred to this Article: For this benefit is the end of the history, Christ therefore suffered and rose again, that for him might be given us Remission of sins, and life everlasting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Art. 6. <hi>When we are Reconciled by Faith, there must needs follow the Righteousness of good works.—But because the infirmity of mans nature is so great, that no man can satisfie the Law, it is necessary to teach men, not only that they must obey the Law, but also how this Obedience pleaseth, lest Consciences fall</hi>

This Obedience then pleaseth, not because it satisfieth the Law, but because the person is in Christ, reconciled by Faith, and believeth that the relicts of his Sin are pardoned. We must ever hold that we obtain remission of sins, and the person is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Righteous, that is, is accepted freely for Christ, by Faith: And afterward that Obedience to the Law pleaseth, and is reputed a certain Righteousness, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth rewards.]</hi> Thus the first Protestants.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The 11th Article of the Church of England (to which we all offer to subscribe) is <hi>[Of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of Man.

                        <p>The said Homilies (of Salvation and Faith) say over and over the same thing.

                        </p>
                        <p>And pag. <hi>[A lively Faith is not only the common belief of the Articles of our Faith, but also a true trust and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and a steadfast hope of all good things to be received at Gods hand; and that although we through</hi>

This is our doctrine of Imputation.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The Saxon Confession oft insisteth on the <hi>free Pardon of sin, not merited by us, but by Christ.</hi> And expoundeth <hi>Justification</hi> to be <hi>[Of unjust, that is, Guilty and disobedient, and not having Christ: to be made Just, that is, To be Absolved from Guilt for the Son of God, and an apprehender by Faith of Christ himself, who is our Righteousness;</hi> (as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> say) <hi>because by his Merit we have forgiveness, and God imputeth righteousness to us, and for him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth us just, and by giving us his Spirit quickeneth and regenerateth us.—By being Justified by Faith alone we mean, that freely for our Mediator alone, not for our Contrition, or other Merits, the pardon of sin and reconciliation is given us.—And before, It is certain, when the mind is raised by this Faith, that the pardon of sin, Reconciliation and Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>

And at the Judgment of God we must not trust to the Merit of any of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which we have, but to the sole Merit of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is made ours by Faith. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at the bar of God, where the case of true eternal Righteousness and Salvation will be pleaded, there is no place for mans Merits, but only for God's Mercy, and the Merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we receive by Faith: therefore we think our Ancestors said rightly, that we are justified before God by Faith only.</hi>

And his death and blood alone is sufficient, to abolish &amp; expiate all the sins of all men. All must come to Christ for pardon and Remission of Sin, Salvation and every thing. All our trust and hope is to be fastened on him alone. Through him only and his merits God is appeas'd and propitious; Loveth us, and giveth us Life eternal.</hi>

Therefore all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons by which men think to be justified before God, we plainly reject; and all opinion of Merit being cast away; we rest only in the Obedience of Christ, which is Imputed to us, both that all our sins may be covered, and that we may get Grace before God.]</hi> So that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Obedience, they think is but for <hi>pardon of sin, and acceptance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning Protestants Judgment of Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is further to be noted; 1. That they are not agreed whether Imputation of Christ's perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Obedience, be before or after the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Passion in order of nature. Some think that our sins are first in order of nature done away by the Imputation of his sufferings, that we may be free from punishment; and next, that his <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is Imputed to us, to merit the Reward of life eternal: But the most learned Confuters of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61305:39"/> hold, that Imputation of Christs <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> together, are in order of nature before our Remission of sin and Acceptance, as the meritorious cause: And these can mean it in no other sence than that which I maintain. So doth <hi>Davenant</hi> de Just. hab. et act. &amp; Pet. Molinaeus Thes. Sedan. Vol. 1. pag. 625. <hi>Imputatio justitiae Christi propter quam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata remittuntur, &amp; censemur justi coram Deo.</hi> Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Thes. Sedan. Vol. 2. pag. 770, 771. § 6 &amp; 10. <hi>maketh the material cause of our Justification to be the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ, yea the Merit of his Satisfaction, and so maketh the formal Cause of Justification to be the Imputation of Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or which is the same, the solemn Remission of all sins, and our free Acceptance with God.</hi> Note that he maketh <hi>Imputation</hi> to be the same thing with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Acceptance;</hi> which is more than the former said.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Note, that when they say that Imputation is the <hi>Form</hi> of Justification, they mean not of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Passively as it is ours, but Actively as it is <hi>Gods Justifying act;</hi> so <hi>Maresius ibidem.</hi> And many deny it to be the form: And many think that saying improper.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Note, that it is ordinarily agreed by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, that Christs Righteousness is imputed to us in the same sence as our sins are said to be imputed to him; (even before they are committed many Ages;) which cleareth fully the whole Controversie to those that are but willing to understand, and blaspheme not Christ; so <hi>Maresius ubi supra: Quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum propter deliquia nostra ei imputata punitus fuit Christus terris; ita &amp; propter ejus Justitiam nobis imputatam coronamur in Caelis.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi>

While he mentioneth only <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet § 27. saith that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is <hi>imputed to us,</hi> and placeth Christs Imputed Righteousness in his Obedience <hi>to the</hi> death; and saith that this <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Obedience, in suffering,</hi> is our Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. <hi>Ea igitur Obedientia Christi qua Patri paruit usque ad mortem crucis, qua coram Patre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paruit ut voluntatem ejus perficeret, qua a Patre mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, ut nos sui sanguinis effusione redimeret, justitiae ejus pro peccatis nostris abunde satisfecit; ea inquam obedientia ex gratia Patris imputata &amp; donata, illa ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia est qua justificamur.</hi> And they ordinarily use the similitude of the Redemption of a Captive, and Imputing the Price to him.

                        <p>The plain truth in all this is within the reach of every sound Christian, and self-conceited wranglers make difficulties where there are none. Yea, how far the Papists themselves grant the Protestant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Imputation, let the following words of <hi>Vasseur</hi> on <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be judg. <hi>[Bellarm. ait; Si solum vellent haeretici nobis imputari Merita Christi, quia nobis donata sunt, &amp; possumus ea Deo Patri offerre pro peccatis nostris, quoniam Christus suscepit super se onus satisfaciendi pro nobis, nosque Deo Patri reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andi, recta esset eorum Sententia:</hi> I doubt some will say, it is false, because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> granteth it; but <hi>Vasseur</hi> addeth <hi>[Haec ille: sed an nostra longe abest ab illâ, quam in nobis requireret sententia.]</hi> And I wish the Reader that loveth Truth and Peace

                     <p>THough a man that readeth our most Learned Protestants, prosessing that they agree even with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself in the stating of the case of Imputation, would think that there should need no further stating of it. I cited you <hi>Bellarmine's</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61305:41"/> words before with <hi>Vasseurs</hi> consent: I here add Johan. Crocius de Justif.

Quod enim cum rectâ ratione pugnare dicit, nos per Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Christi formaliter justos nominari &amp; esse, nos non tangit: Non dicimus; Non sentimus: Sed hoc totum proficiscitur e Sophistarum officinâ, qui phrasin istam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis offingunt, ut postea eam exagitent tanquam nostram:</hi> (yet some of our own give them this pretence.) <hi>Nos sententiam quam ille rectam judicat, tenemus, tuemur; sic tamen ut addamus, quod Genti adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae est intolerabile, non alia ratione nos justos cense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri coram Deo.]</hi> But by Justification the Papists mean Sanctification: And they count it not intolerable to say that the penalty of our sins is remitted to us, by that Satisfaction to the Justice of God according to the Law of Innocency, which Christ only hath made. But though many thrust in more indeed, and most of them much more in words; yet you see they are forced to say as we say whether they will or not: For they seem unwilling to be thought to agree with us, where they agree indeed.] And the following words of <hi>Job.

                        <hi>Christ's Righteousness, which we rather call the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cause.—</hi>§ 32. <hi>Christs satisfaction is made for all: But it is imputed to us, not as it is made for all, but as for us. I illustrate it by the like. The Kings Son payeth the debt of a Community deeply indebted to the King, and thence bound to perpetual slavery. This payment gets liberty for this, and that, and the other member of the Community: For it is imputed to them by the King as if they had paid it. But this Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion transferreth not the honour to them, but brings them to partake of the Benefit. So when the price paid by Christ for all, is imputed to this or that man, he is taken into the society of the Benefit,—</hi>Pag. 503. <hi>Distinguish between the Benefit, and the Office of Christ. The former is made ours, but not the latter,—</hi>Pag. 542. <hi>The Remission of sin is nothing but the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs Righteousness.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>Where Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Righteousness, Remission of Iniquities, and non-imputation of sin, are all one,—</hi>Pag. 547. <hi>God imputeth it as far as he pleaseth,—</hi>Pag. 548. <hi>Princes oft impute the merits of Parents so unworthy Children,—</hi>Pag. 551.

                     </p>
                     <p>But I will a little more distinctly open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Case.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We must distinguish of <hi>Righteousness</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to the Preceptive part of the Law▪ and as it relateth to the Retributive part: The first <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> is <hi>Innocency</hi> contrary to <hi>Reatus Culpae:</hi> The second is <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; ad praemium (sen d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>num,) Right to Impunity and to the Reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We must distinguish of <hi>Christs Righteousness,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61305:42"/> which is either so called, <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> which is the <hi>Relation of Christs person</hi> to his <hi>Law of Mediation</hi> imposed on him, 1. As <hi>Innocent</hi> and a perfect obeyer; 2. As one that <hi>deserved not punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but deserved Reward.</hi> Or it is so called <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi> and <hi>improperly;</hi> which is, Those <hi>same Habits, Acts and Sufferings</hi> of Christ, from which <hi>his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Righteous</hi> did result.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We must distinguish of <hi>Imputation,</hi> which signifyeth (here) 1. To repute us <hi>personally</hi> to have been the <hi>Agents of Christs Acts,</hi> the <hi>subjects▪</hi> of his <hi>Habits and Passion</hi> in a Physical sence. 2. Or to repute the same <hi>formal Relation</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> which was in Christs person, to be in <hi>ours</hi> as the <hi>subject.</hi> 3. Or to repute us to have been the very <hi>subjects of Christ's Habits and Passion,</hi> and the Agents of his <hi>Acts</hi> in a <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Moral sense,</hi> (and not a physical); as a man payeth a debt by his Servant, or Attorney, or Delegate. 4. And consequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a <hi>double formal Righteousness</hi> to result from the said <hi>Habits, Acts,</hi> and <hi>Passions;</hi> one to <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>natural Subject</hi> and <hi>Agent,</hi> and <hi>another to us</hi> as the <hi>Moral, Political,</hi> or <hi>reputed Subject</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi> (And so his <hi>Formal Righteousness</hi> not to be imputed to us <hi>in it self as ours,</hi> but <hi>another</hi> to result from the same <hi>Matter.)</hi> 5. Or else that we are reputed both the <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, morally and also of the <hi>Formal Righteousness</hi> of <hi>Christ himself.</hi> 6. Or else by Imputation is meant here, that Christ being truly reputed to have taken the Nature of sinful than, and become a Head for all true Believers, in that undertaken <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>all the Law imposed on him,</hi> by perfect <hi>Holiness</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61305:43"/> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Offering</hi> himself on the Cross a <hi>Sacrifice for our sins,</hi> voluntarily suffering in our stead, as if he had been a sinner, (guilty of all our sins) As soon as we believe we are pardoned, justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adopted for <hi>the sake and merit</hi> of this Holiness, Obedience and penal Satisfaction of Christ, with as full demonstration of divine <hi>Justice,</hi> at least, and more full demonstration of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> than if we had suffered our selves what our sins deserved (that is, been damned) or had never sinned: And so <hi>Righteousness is imputed to us,</hi> that is, <hi>we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or reputed righteous,</hi> (not in relation to the Precept, that is, <hi>innocent,</hi> or <hi>sinless,</hi> but in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Retribution,</hi> that is, <hi>such as have Right to Impunity and Life,)</hi> because Christ's foresaid perfect Holiness, Obedience and Satisfaction, <hi>merited our Pardon, and Adoption, and the Spirit;</hi> or merited the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> by which, as an Instrument, <hi>Pardon, Justification and Adoption</hi> are given to Believers, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be given to sanctifie them: And when we believe, we are justly <hi>reputed</hi> such as have <hi>Right</hi> to all these purchased Gifts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And that it may be understood how far Christ did <hi>Obey</hi> or <hi>Suffer</hi> in our <hi>stead,</hi> or <hi>person,</hi> we must distinguish, 1. Between his taking the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>sinful</hi> man, and taking the Person of sinners. 2. Between his taking the <hi>Person</hi> of a <hi>sinner,</hi> and taking the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> and each particular sinner. 3. Between his taking our sinful persons <hi>simply, &amp; ad omnia,</hi> and taking them only, <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid, in tantum, &amp; ad hoc.</hi> 4. Between his <hi>suffering</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of sinners, and his <hi>obeying</hi> and <hi>sanctity in the Person</hi> of sinners or of us in particular.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Between his <hi>Obeying</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> in <hi>our Person,</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61305:43"/> and our <hi>Obeying</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> in his Person <hi>(Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Political.)</hi> And now I shall make use of these distinctions, by the Propositions following.</p>
                     <p>Prop. 1. The phrase of <hi>[Christ's Righteousness imputed to us]</hi> is not in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore when it cometh to Disputation, to them that deny it, some Scripture-phrase should be put in stead of it; because, 1. The Scripture hath as good, if not much better, phrases, to signifie all in this that is necessary. 2. And it is supposed that the Disputants are agreed of all that is express in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet so much is said in Scripture, as may make this phrase <hi>[of Imputing Christ's Righteousness to us]</hi> justifiable, in the sound sence here explained: For the thing meant by it is true, and the phrase intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Christ's Righteousness is imputed to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in the sixth sence here before explained; As the Meritorious cause of our Pardon, Justification, Righteousness, Adoption, Sanctification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. as is opened.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Christ did not suffer all in kind (much less in duration) which sinful man deserved to suffer: As <hi>e. g.</hi> 1. He was not hated of God; 2. Nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived or deserted of the sanctifying Spirit, and so of its Graces and Gods Image; Nor had 3. any of that permitted penalty by which sin it self is a misery and punishment to the sinner. 4. He fell not under the Power of the Devil as a deceiver and ruler, as the ungodly do. 5. His Conscience did not accuse him of sin, and torment him for it. 6. He did not totally despair of ever being saved. 7. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61305:44"/> fire of Hell did not torment his body. More such instances may be given for proof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Christ did not perform all the same obedience in kind, which many men, yea all men, are or were bound to perform. As 1. He did not dress and keep that Garden which <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to dress and keep. 2. He did not the conjugal offices which <hi>Adam,</hi> and millions more, were bound to. 3. Nor the Paternal Office to Children. 4. Nor all the offices of a King on Earth, or Magistrate: nor of a Servant, &amp;c. Nor the duty of the Sick. 5. He did not repent of sin, nor turn from it to God, nor mortifie or resist in himself any sinful lust; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Saviour by Faith, nor was circumcised or baptized for the Remission of his sins; nor loved God or thanked him for redeeming or pardoning him; nor obeyed God in the use of any Ordinance or Means, for the subduing of sin, and healing or saving of his Soul from any sin or deserved wrath of God; with much more such.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Christ did perform much which no man else was bound to do: As to redeem Souls, to work his Miracles and the rest of the works, peculiar to the Mediator.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That Law which bound us to Suffering, (or made it our due) bound not Christ to it, (as being innocent); But he was bound to it by the Fathers Law of Mediator, and by his own voluntary spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Law obliging every sinner himself to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, was not <hi>fulfilled</hi> by the <hi>Suffering</hi> of Christ our Sponsor: But only the <hi>Lawgiver satisfied</hi> by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its Ends. For neither the letter nor sence of it said, <hi>[If thou sin, thou or thy surety shall suffer.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61305:44"/> 10. Christ <hi>satisfied Justice</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> in <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> which also was <hi>Holy</hi> in him.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He did not this as a <hi>Natural</hi> Root, or Head to man, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; to convey <hi>Holiness</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> by <hi>natural propagation,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> should have done; and did by sin: For Christ had no Wife or natural Children; But as a <hi>Head, by Contract</hi> as a Husband to a Wife, and a King to a Kingdom, and a <hi>Head of Spiritual Influx.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. No as being <hi>Actually</hi> such a Head to the Redeemed when he <hi>Obeyed</hi> and <hi>Suffered;</hi> but as a Head by <hi>Aptitude</hi> and <hi>Office, Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> who was to <hi>become a Head actually</hi> to every one when they <hi>Believed</hi> and <hi>Consented;</hi> Being before a <hi>Head for them,</hi> and <hi>over those that did exist,</hi> but not a <hi>Head to them,</hi> in act.</p>

There is therefore but one of these two ways left, <hi>Either that we our selves in person, truly had the habits which Christ had, and did all that Christ did, and suffered all that he suffered, and so satisfied and merited Life in and by him, as by an Instrument, or Legal Representer of our persons in all this;</hi> Which I am anon to Confute: or else, That <hi>Christs Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> Righteousness, and the <hi>Habits, Acts</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> in which it lay, are imputed to us, and made ours; not rigidly in the very thing it self, but in the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Benefits;</hi> In as much as we are as really <hi>Pardoned, Justified, Adopted</hi> by them, as the Meritorious cause, by the instrumentality of the Covenants Donation, as if we our selves had done and suffered all that Christ did, as a Mediator and Sponsor, do and suffer for us: I say, As <hi>really</hi> and <hi>certainly,</hi> and with a fuller demonstration of Gods Mercy and Wisdom, and with a sufficient demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Justice.

For <hi>Faith to be imputed to us for Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4. 22, 23, 24. is plainly meant, that God who under the Law of Innocency required perfect Obedience, of us to our Justification and Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>merits</hi> of Christ, hath freely given a full <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Life,</hi> to all true Believers; so that now by the Covenant of Grace nothing is required <hi>of us,</hi> to our Justification, but <hi>Faith:</hi> all the rest being done by Christ: And so Faith in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is reputed truly to be the condition on our part, on which Christ and Life, by that Baptismal Covenant, are made ours.</p>
                     <p n="35">35.

                     <p n="36">36. It is an error contrary to the scope of the Gospel to say, that <hi>the Law of Works, or of Innocency,</hi> doth justifie us, as performed either by our selves, or by Christ.

                        <hi>any action,</hi> that action is called <hi>the Matter</hi> of his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> in such an Analogical sense as Action, an <hi>Accident</hi> may be called <hi>Matter,</hi> because the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of Righteous is founded or subjected first or partly in that <hi>Action.</hi> And so when Christ perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>obeyed,</hi> it was the <hi>Matter of his Righteousness.</hi> But to be Righteous and to <hi>Merit</hi> are not all one notion: Merit is adventitious to meer Righteousness. Now it is not Christs <hi>Actions</hi> in themselves that our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness resulteth from immediately as his own did; But there is first his <hi>Action,</hi> then his <hi>formal Righteousness thereby;</hi> and <hi>thirdly, his Merit</hi> by that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which goes to procure the <hi>Covenant-Donation</hi> of Righteousnass to us, by which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant we are <hi>efficiently</hi> made Righteous.

Above all, consider what that <hi>Righteousness</hi> is which Christ merited for us, (which is the heart of the Controversie.) It is not of the same <hi>species</hi> or sort with his own. His Righteousness was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>sinless Innocency,</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Law of Innocency in Holiness.</hi> Ours is not such. The dissenters think it is such by <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and here is the difference.

                        <hi>of Grace</hi> that we are judged and justified. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, 1. We are not <hi>really</hi> or <hi>reputatively such</hi> as have <hi>perfectly fulfilled</hi> all <hi>its Precepts:</hi> 2. But we are such as by Grace do <hi>sincerely perform</hi> the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of its promise. 3. By which promise of Gift, we are such as have right to Christs own <hi>person,</hi> in the Relation and Union of a Head and Saviour, and with him the pardon of all our sins, and the <hi>right of Adoption to the Spirit, and the Heavenly Inheritance</hi> as <hi>purchased by Christ.</hi> So that besides our Inherent or Adherent Righteousness of sincere <hi>Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Obedience,</hi> as the performed condition of the Law of Grace, we have no other Righteousness our selves, but <hi>Right to Impunity and to Life:</hi> and not any <hi>imputed sinless Innocency</hi> at all. God <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth</hi> our sins and <hi>adopteth</hi> us, for the sake of Christs sufferings and <hi>perfect Holiness:</hi> But he doth not account us <hi>perfectly Holy</hi> for it, nor <hi>perfectly Obedient.</hi> So that how-ever you will call it, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> a <hi>Material Cause</hi> or a <hi>Meritorious,</hi> the thing is plain.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True: But that's none of the question. But how is he so made? 1. As he is made Wisdom, Sanctification and Redemption as aforesaid. 2. By Merit, Satisfaction, Direction, Prescription and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He is the Meritorious Cause of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, of our Adoption, of our Right to Heaven, of that new Covenant which is the Instrumental Deed of Gift, confirming all these: And he is also our Righteousness in the sense that <hi>Austin</hi> so much standeth on, as all our Holiness and Righteousness of Heart and Life, is not of our natural endeavour, but his gift, and operation by his Spirit; causing us
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61305:49"/> to obey his Holy precepts and Example. All these ways he is made of God our Righteousness: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Objective way of sense; as he is <hi>Objectively</hi> made our <hi>Wisdom,</hi> because it is the truest wisdom to know him; So he is objectively made our <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> in that it is that Gospel-Righteousness which is required <hi>of our selves,</hi> by his grace, to believe in him and obey him.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Though Christ fulfilled not the Law by Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Holiness and Actual Obedience, strictly in the Individual person of each particular sinner; yet he did it in the nature of Man: And so humane nature, (considered <hi>in specie,</hi> and in Christ personally, though not considered as <hi>a totum,</hi> or as personally in each man,) did satisfie and fullfil the Law and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As Humane Nature sinned in <hi>Adam</hi> actually in <hi>specie,</hi> and in his individual person, and all our <hi>Persons</hi> were <hi>seminally</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> in him, and accordingly sinned, or are reputed sinners, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no nature but what he conveyed who could convey no better than he had (either as to Relation or Real quality): But not that God reputed us to have been <hi>actually existent,</hi> as <hi>really distinct persons</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> (which is not true.) Even so Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and suffered in our <hi>Nature,</hi> and in our nature as it was in him; and humane sinful nature in <hi>specie</hi> was Universally pardoned by him, and <hi>Eternal life freely given to all men</hi> for his merits, thus far impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, their sins being not imputed to hinder this Gift; which is made in and by the Covenant of Grace: Only the Gift hath the Condition of mans Acceptance of it according to its nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And all the individuals that shall in time by Faith accept the Gift, are there and thereby made

As <hi>Adam</hi> was a Head by <hi>Nature,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conveyed Guilt by natural Generation; so Christ is a Head (not by nature but) by Sacred Contract; and therefore conveyeth Right to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Adoption and Salvation, not by Generation, but by Contract, or Donation. So that what it was to be <hi>naturally</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> seminally and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, though not personlly in existence; even that it is, in order to our benefit by him to be <hi>in Christ by Contract or the new Covenant,</hi> virtually, though not in personal existence when the Covenant was made.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. They therefore that look upon Justification or Righteousness, as coming to us immediately by Imputation of Christs Righteousness to us, without the Instrumental Intervention and Conveyance or Collation by this Deed of Gift or Covenant, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found themselves by confounding and overlooking the Causes of our Justification. That which Christ did by his merits was to procure the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The new Covenant is a free Gift of pardon and life with Christ himself, for his merits and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction sake.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Though the Person of the Mediator be not really or reputatively the very <hi>person of each sinner,</hi> (nor so <hi>many persons</hi> as there are <hi>sinners</hi> or <hi>believers,)</hi> yet it doth belong to the <hi>Person of the Mediator,</hi> so far (limitedly) to <hi>bear the person of a sinner,</hi> and to stand in the place of the <hi>Persons of all Sinners,</hi> as to bear the punishment they deserved, and to suffer for their sins.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. Scripture speaking of moral matters, usually speaketh rather in Moral than meer Physical
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61305:50"/> phrase: And in strict Physical sence, Christs very personal Righteousness (Material or Formal) is not so given to us, as that we are proprietors of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing it self, but only of the effects (Pardon, Righteousness and Life,) yet in a larger Moral phrase that very thing is oft said to be given to us, which is given to another, or done or suffered for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. He that ransometh a Captive from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer, Physically giveth the Money to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer &amp; not to the Captive, &amp; giveth the Captive only the Liberty purchased: But <hi>morally</hi> and reputatively he is said to give the Money to the Captive, because he gave it <hi>for him.</hi> And it redeemeth him as well as if he had given it himself. He that giveth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds to purchase Lands, &amp; freely giveth that land to another; physically giveth the <hi>Money</hi> to the <hi>Seller</hi> only, and the Land only to the other. But morally and reputatively we content our selves with the metonymical phrase, and say, he gave the other ten thousand pound. So morally it may be said, that Christs Righteousness, Merits and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, was given to us, in that the thing purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by it was given to us; when the Satisfaction was given or made to God. Yea when we said it was made to God, we mean only that he was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively the <hi>Terminus</hi> of active Satisfaction, being the party satisfyed; but not that he himself was made the Subject and Agent of Habits and Acts, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ as in his humane nature, except as the Divine Nature acted it, or by Communication of Attributes.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Because the words <hi>[Person]</hi> and <hi>[Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting]</hi> and <hi>[Representing]</hi> are ambiguous (as all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane language is,) while some use them in a <hi>stricter</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61305:51"/>
                        <hi>sense</hi> than others do, we must try by other explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory terms whether we agree in the matter, and not lay the stress of our Controversy upon the bare words. So some Divines say that Christ suffered in the <hi>Person of a sinner,</hi> when they mean not that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Natural person of any one particular sinner; but that his own <hi>Person</hi> was reputed the Sponsor of sinners by God, and that he was judged a real sinner by his persecuters; and so suffered as if he had been a sinner.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. As Christ is less improperly said to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented our Persons in his satisfactory Sufferings, than in his personal perfect <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> so he is less improperly said to have <hi>Represented all mankind as newly fallen in Adam, in a General sense, for the purchasing of the universal Gift of Pardon and Life, called The new Covenant; than to have Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in his perfect Holiness and his Sufferings, every Believer considered as from his first being to his Death.</hi> Though it is certain that he dyed for all their sins from first to last. For it is most true, 1. That Christ is as a second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Root of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; And as we derive sin from <hi>Adam,</hi> so we derive life from Christ, (allowing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Natural and a Voluntary way of derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) And though no mans <hi>Person</hi> as a <hi>Person</hi> was actually <hi>existent</hi> and <hi>offended</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> (nor was by God reputed to have been and done) yet all mens Persons were <hi>Virtually</hi> and <hi>Seminally</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> as is aforesaid; and when they <hi>are existent persons,</hi> they are no better either by <hi>Relative Innocency,</hi> or by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Disposition,</hi> than he could propagate: and are truly and justly reputed by God to be <hi>Persons Guilty of Adams fact,</hi> so far as they were by nature
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61305:51"/> seminally and virtually in him: And Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> is in a sort the root of <hi>Man as Man,</hi> (though not by propagation of us, yet) as he is the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> it self from destruction, but more notably the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Saints as Saints,</hi> who are to have no real sanctity but what shall be derived from him by Regeneration, as Nature and Sin is from <hi>Adam</hi> by Generation. But <hi>Adam</hi> did not represent all his posterity as to all the Actions which they should do themselves from their Birth to their Death; so that they should all have been taken for perfectly obedient to the death, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned at that time, yea or during his Life. For if any of them under that Covenant had ever sinned afterward in their own person, they should have died for it. But for the time past, they were Guiltless or Guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was Guiltless or Guilty himself, so far as they were in <hi>Adam:</hi> And though that was but in <hi>Causâ, &amp; non extra causam;</hi> Yet a Generating Cause which propagateth essence from essence, by self-multiplication of form, much differeth from an <hi>Arbitrary facient Cause</hi> in this. If <hi>Adam</hi> had obeyed, yet all his posterity had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless bound to perfect personal persevering O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience on pain of Death. And Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> so far bore the person of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and suffered in the nature and room of Mankind in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as without any condition on their part at all; to give man by an act of Oblivion or new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a pardon of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, yea and of all sin past, at the time of their consent, though not disobliging them from all future Obedience. And by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holiness and Obedience and Sufferings, he hath merited that new Covenant, which <hi>Accepteth</hi> of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61305:52"/> sincere, though imperfect, Obedience, and maketh no more in us necessary to Salvation. When I say he did this <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Condition</hi> on mans part, I mean, He <hi>absolutely without Condition, merited and gave us the Justifying Testament</hi> or <hi>Covenant.</hi> Though that Covenant give us not Justification absolutely, but on Condition of <hi>believing, fiducial Consent.</hi> 2. And so as this <hi>Ʋniversal Gift</hi> of Justification upon Acceptance, is actually given to all fallen mankind as such; so Christ might be said to suffer instead of all, yea and merit too, so far as to procure them this Covenant-gift.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. The sum of all lyeth in applying the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of giving Christs Righteousness <hi>as such in it self,</hi> and as <hi>a cause of our Righteousness,</hi> or in the <hi>Causality of it.</hi> As our sin is not reputed Christs sin <hi>in it self,</hi> and in the culpability of it (for then it must needs make Christ odious to God) but in its <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of punishment:</hi> so Christ's Material or Formal Righteousness, is not by God reputed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and absolutely <hi>our own</hi> in <hi>it self</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> but the <hi>Causality</hi> of it as it produceth such and such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. The Objections which are made against Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christs Righteousness in the sound sense, may all be answered as they are by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; among whom the chiefest on this subject are <hi>Davenant de Justit. Habit Habit &amp; Actual. Johan. Crocius de Justif. Nigrinus de Impletione Legis,</hi> Bp. <hi>G. Dowman of Justif. Chamier, Paraeus, Amesius and Junius</hi> against <hi>Bellarm.</hi> But the same reasons against the unsound sence of Imputation are unanswerable. Therefore if any shall say concerning my following Arguments, that most of them are used, by <hi>Gregor.</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61305:52"/>
                        <hi>de Valent.</hi> by <hi>Bellarm. Becanus,</hi> or other Papists, or by Socinians, and are answered by <hi>Nigrinus, Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. Such words may serve to deceive the simple that are led by Names and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; but to the Intelligent they are contemptible, unless they prove that these objections are made by the Papists against the same sence of Imputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which I use them, and that it is that sense which all those Protestants defend in answering them: For who-ever so answereth them, will appear to answer them in vain.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. How far those Divines who do use the phrase of <hi>Christs suffering in our person,</hi> do yet limit the sense in their exposition, and deny that we are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have fulfilled the Law in Christ: because it is redious to cite many, I shall take up now with one, even Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> in his <hi>Theopolitica,</hi> which (though about the office of Faith he some-what differ from me) I must needs call an excellent Treatise, as I take the Author to be one of the most Knowing men yet living that I know.)

                        <p>Pag. 100, 101. [If we enquire of the manner how Righteousness and Life is derived from Christ, being one unto so many, it cannot be, except Christ be a general Head of mankind, and one Person with them, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, We do not read of any but two who were general Heads, and in some respect virtually, <hi>All mankind;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Adam.—</hi>The <note place="margin">Mark, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61305:53"/> But, 2. How far is he <hi>One person with us?</hi> Ans. 1. In general so far as it pleased God to make him so, and no further. 2. In <note place="margin">Not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</note> particular, He and we are one so far 1. As to make him liable to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law for us. 2. So far as to free us from that obligation, and derive the benefit of his death to us. Though Christ be so far one with us as to be lyable unto the penalty of the Law, and to suffer it, and upon this suffering we are freed; yet Christ is not the sinner, nor the sinner Christ. Christ is the Word made flesh, innocent without sin, an universal Priest and King: but we are none of these. Though we be accounted as one person in Law with him, by a <note place="margin">Mark by a Trope.</note> Trope; yet in proper sence it cannot be said <hi>that in Christ's Satisfying we satisfied for our own sins.</hi> For then we should have been the Word made flesh, able to plead Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are false, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, blasphemous if affirmed by any. <note place="margin">Mark how far.</note> It's true, we are so one with him, that he satisfied for us, and the benefit of this Satisfaction redounds to us, and is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all, upon certain termes; though not actually communicated to all: From this Unity and Identity of person in Law (if I may so speak) it followeth clearly that Christ's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were not only Afflictions, but Punishments in proper sense.<hi>—Pag.</hi> 102, 103. That Christ died for all in some sence must needs be granted, because the Scripture expresly affirms it <hi>(vid. reliqua.)—</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another question unprofitably hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61305:53"/> Whether the <hi>Propitiation</hi> which includeth both Satisfaction and Merit, be to be ascribed to the Active or Passive Obedience of Christ? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Both his Active, Personal, Perfect and Perpetual Obedience, which by reason of his humane nature assumed, and subjection unto God was due, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that Obedience to the great and transcendent Command of suffering the death of the Cross, both concur as Causes of Remission and Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. The Scriptures usually ascribe it to the Blood, Death, &amp; Sacrifice of Christ, and never to the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Active Obedience of Christ's to the Moral Law. 3. Yet this Active Obedience is necessary, because without it he could not have offered that great Sacrifice of himself without spot to God. And if it had not been without spot, it could not have been propitiatory and effectual for Expiation. 4. If Christ as our Surety had performed for us perfect and perpetual Obedience, so that we might have been judged to have perfectly and fully kept the Law by him, then no sin could have been chargeable upon us, and the Death of Christ had been needless and superfluous. 5. Christs Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation freeth the Believer not only from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto punishment of sense, but of loss; and procured for him not only deliverance from evil deserved, but the enjoyment of all good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our full happiness. Therefore, there is no ground of Scripture for that opinion, that the Death of Christ and his Sufferings free us from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, and by his Active Obedience imputed to us we are made righteous, and the heirs of life. 6. If Christ was bound to perform perfect and perpetual Obedience for us, and he also performed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61305:54"/> it for us, then we are freed not only from sin, but Obedience too: And this Obedience as distinct and separate from Obedience unto death, may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Justification of Life, and will be sufficient to carry the Cause. For the tenor of the Law was this, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> And if man do this by himself or Surety, so as that the Lawgiver and supreme Judg accept it, the Law can require no more. It could not bind to perfect Obedience and to punishment too. There was never any such Law made by God or just men. Before I conclude this particular of the extent of Christs Merit and Propitiation, I thought good to inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as the Propitiation of Christ maketh no man absolutely, but upon certain terms pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and savable; so it was never made, either to prevent all sin, or all punishments: For it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth man both sinful and miserable: And we know that the Guilt and Punishment of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, lyeth heavy on all his posterity to this day. And not only that, but the guilt of actual and personal sins lyeth wholly upon us, whilest impenitent and unbelieving and so out of Christ. And the Regenerate themselves are not fully freed from all punishments till the final Resurrection and Judgment. So that his Propitiation doth not altogether prevent but remove sin and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by degrees. Many sins may be said to be Remissible by vertue of this Sacrifice, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be remitted.] So far Mr. <hi>Lawson.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Here I would add only these Animadversions. 1. That whereas he explaineth <hi>Christs personating us</hi> in suffering by the similitude of a Debtor and his Surety who are the same person in Law: I note 1.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61305:54"/> That the case of Debt much differeth from the case of Punishment. 2. That a Surety of Debt is either antecedently such, or consequently: Antecedently, either first one that is bound equally with the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; 2. or one that promiseth to pay if he do not. I think the Law accounteth neither of these to be the <hi>Person</hi> of the principal Debtor (as it doth a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant by whom he sends the Debt.) But Christ was neither of these: For the Law did not beforehand oblige him with us, nor did he in Law-sence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to pay the Debt, if we failed. Though God decreed that he should do so; yet that was no part of the sence of the Law. But consequently, if a friend of the Debtor when he is in Jayl will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his request or knowledg, say to the Creditor, I will pay you all the Debt; but so that he shall be in my power, and not have present liberty (lest he abuse it) but on the terms that I shall please; yea not at all if he ungratefully reject it] This <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> Satisfyer, or Sponsor, or Paymaster, is not in Law-sence the same <hi>Person</hi> with the Debtor: But if any will call him so, I will not contend about a word, while we agree of the thing (the terms of deliverance.) And this is as near the Case between Christ and us, as the similitude of a Debtor will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I do differ from Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> and <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>Ʋrsine,</hi> and <hi>Olevian,</hi> and <hi>Scultetus</hi> and all that sort of worthy Divines in this; that whereas they make Christs Holiness and perfect Obedience to be but <hi>Justitia personae,</hi> necessary to make his Sacrifice spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and so effectual: I think that <hi>of it self</hi> it is as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the cause of our Pardon, Justification and Life, as Christs Passion is; The Passion being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61305:55"/> and so meritorious, and the personal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Meritorious and so Satisfactory. For the truth is, The Law that condemned us was not fulfilled by Christs suffering for us, but the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied instead of the fulfilling of it: And that Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyeth, in the substitution of that which as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (or more) attaineth the ends of the Law as our own suffering would have done. Now the ends of the Law may be attained by immediate Merit of Perfection as well as by Suffering; but best by both. For 1. By the perfect Holiness and Obedience of Christ, the Holy and perfect will of God is <hi>pleased:</hi> whence <hi>[This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.]</hi> 2. In order to the ends of Government, Holiness and perfect Obedience, is honoured and freed from the contempt which sin would cast upon it; and the holiness <hi>of the Law</hi> in its <hi>Precepts</hi> is publickly honoured in this grand Exemplar; In whom only the will of God was done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven. And such a Specimen to the World is greatly conducible to the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that Christ voluntarily taking humane nature, which as such is obliged to this Perfection, He first highly merited of God the Father hereby, and this with his Suffering, went to attain the ends that our suffering should have attained, much better. So that at least as <hi>Meritorious,</hi> if not secondarily as <hi>satisfactory,</hi> I see not but <hi>Christs Holiness</hi> procureth the <hi>Justifying Covenant</hi> for us, equally with his Death. A Prince may pardon a Traitor for <hi>some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble service of his Friend,</hi> as well as for his suffering: much more for both. This way go <hi>Grotius de satisf.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> saith that the Law binds
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61305:55"/> not to Obedience and Punishment both, he meaneth as to the same Act: which contradicts not what <hi>Nigrinus</hi> and others say, that it binds a sinner to punishment for sin past, and yet to Obedience for the time to come: (which cannot be entire and perfect.)</p>
                     <p>So pag. 311. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Qu</hi> 2. Whether there be two parts of Justification, Remission and Imputation of Christs Righteousness. 1. He referreth us to what is aforecited against Imputation of Christs Active Righteousness, separated or abstracted for Reward from the Passive. 2. He sheweth that <hi>Paul</hi> taketh <hi>Remission of sin and Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for the same thing.]</hi> So say many of ours.</p>
                     <p>In conclusion I will mind the Reader, that by reading some Authors for Imputation, I am brought to doubt whether some deny not all true Remission of sin, that is, Remission of the deserved punishment. Because I find that by <hi>Remission</hi> they mean <hi>A non-Imputation of sin under the formal notion of sin;</hi> that God taketh it not to be our sin, but Christs; and Christs Righteousness and perfection to be so ours, as that God accounteth us not as truly sinners. And so they think that the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> as well as <hi>Poenae</hi> simply in it self is done away. Which if it be so, then the <hi>Reatus Poenae,</hi> the obligation to punishment, or the <hi>dueness</hi> of punishment, cannot be said to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or remitted, because it was never contracted. Where I hold, that it is the <hi>Reatus ad Poenam</hi> the <hi>Dueness</hi> of punishment only that is remitted, and the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> not as in it self, but in its <hi>Causality</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And so in all common language, we say we forgive a man his fault, when we forgive him all the penalty positive and privative. Not esteeming him, 1. Never to have done the fact. 2. Or that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61305:56"/> fact not to have been a fault, <hi>and his fault;</hi> 3. but that punishment for that fault, is forgiven him, and the fault so far as it is a cause of punishment. We must not feign God to judg falsly.</p>
                     <p>This maketh me think of a saying of Bp. <hi>Ʋshers</hi> to me, when I mentioned the Papists placing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Remission of sin conjunct, he told me that the Papists ordinarily acknowledg no Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And on search I find that <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the most of them place no true Remission of sin, in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For by <hi>Remission</hi> (which they make part of Justification,) they mean <hi>Mortification, or destroying sin it self</hi> in the act or habit. But that the <hi>pardon</hi> of the punishment is a thing that we all need, is not denyable; nor do they deny it, though they deny it to be part of our Justification. For it's strange if they deny Christ the pardoning power which they give the Pope. And as <hi>Joh. Crocius de Justif.</hi> oft tells them, They should for shame grant that Christs Righteousness may be as far imputed to us, as they say a Saints or Martyrs redundant merits and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogations are.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Fact and Guilt of Fault</hi> in it self considered, be not both imputed first to us, that is, If we be not judged sinners, I cannot see how we can be judged <hi>Pardoned sinners;</hi> For he that is judged to have no sin, is judged to deserve no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Unless they will say that to prevent the <hi>form and desert</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> is <hi>eminenter,</hi> though not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi> to forgive. But it is another (even Actual) forgiveness which we hear of in the Gospel, and pray for daily in the Lords prayer. Of all which see the full Scripture-proof in Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> of <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin.</hi>

                     <p>§ 1. THE Righteousness of a Person is formally a moral Relation of that Person.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. This moral Relation, is the Relation of that person to the <hi>Rule</hi> by which he is to be judged.</p>
                     <p>§ 3. And it is his Relation to some <hi>Cause,</hi> or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Accusation or Question to be decided by that judgment.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. The Rule of Righteousness here is Gods Law, naturally or supernaturally made known.</p>

                     <p> § 5. The Law hath a Preceptive part, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what shall be due from us, and a Retributive part determining what shall be due to us.</p>
                     <p>§ 6. The Precept instituting Duty, our Actions and Dispositions, which are the Matter of that duty, are physically considered, conform or disconform to the Precept.</p>
                     <p>§ 7. Being Physically, they are consequently so Morally considered, we being Moral Agents, and the Law a Rule of Morality.</p>
                     <p>§ 8. If the <hi>Actions</hi> be righteous or unrighteous, consequently the Person is so, in reference to those Actions, supposing that to be his <hi>Cause,</hi> or the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> to be decided.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. Unrighteousness as to this Cause, is <hi>Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Reatus Culpae;</hi> and to be unrighteous is to be <hi>Sons,</hi> or Guilty of sin.</p>
                     <p>§ 10. The <hi>Retributive</hi> part of the Law is, 1. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miant, for Obedience; 2. Penal, for Disobedience.</p>
                     <p>§ 11. To be Guilty or Unrighteous as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is, to have no right to the reward (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed the Question in judgment): And to be Righteous here, is to have <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 12. To be <hi>Guilty</hi> as to the penalty; is to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re puniendus,</hi> or <hi>Reus poenae,</hi> or <hi>obligatus ad poenam.</hi> And to be righteous here, is to have <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, (quoad poenam damni &amp; sensus.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 13. The first Law made <hi>personal, perfect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing Innocency</hi> both mans duty, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reward and Impunity, and any sin the condition of punishment.</p>
                     <p>§ 14. Man broke this Law, and so lost his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and so the Condition became naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to him, <hi>de futuro.</hi>

                     <p> § 15. Therefore that Law as a Covenant, that is, the Promissory part with its Condition, ceased; <hi>cessante capacitate subditi;</hi> and so did the preceptive part. 1. As it commanded absolute Innocency (of act and habit.) 2. And as it commanded the seeking of the Reward on the Condition and by the means of personal Innocency. The Condition thus passing into the nature of a sentence; And punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining due for the sin.</p>
                     <p>§ 16. But the Law remained still an obliging Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for future perfect Obedience, and made punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for all future sin: and these two parts of it, as the Law of lapsed Nature, remained in force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first sin, and the new-Covenant promise or Law of Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 17. The eternal Word interposing, a Mediator is promised, and Mercy maketh a Law of Grace, and the Word becometh mans Redeemer by underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and by present actual reprieve, pardon and initial deliverance: and the fallen world, the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sinners, with the Law and obligations which they were under, are now become the Redemers <hi>jure Redemptionis,</hi> as before they were the Creator's <hi>jure Creationis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 18. The Redeemers Law then hath two parts; 1. The said Law of lapsed nature (binding to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perfect obedience or punishment) which he found man under (called vulgarly the Moral Law.) 2. And a pardoning Remedying Law of Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 19. Because man had dishonoured God and his Law by sin, the Redeemer undertook to take mans nature without sin, and by perfect Holiness and Obedience, and by becoming a Sacrifice for sin, to bring that Honour to God and his Law which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61305:59"/> we should have done, and to attain the Ends of Law and Government instead of our <hi>Perfection</hi> or <hi>Punishment,</hi> that for the Merit hereof we might be delivered and live.</p>
                     <p>§ 20. This he did in the third person of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who as such had a Law or Covenant proper to himself, the Conditions of which he performed, (by perfect keeping, 1. The Law of Innocency; 2. Of <hi>Moses;</hi> 3. And that proper to himself alone) and so merited all that was promised to him, for Himself and Us.</p>
                     <p>§ 21. By his Law of Grace (as our Lord-Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) he gave first to all mankind (in <hi>Adam,</hi> and after in <hi>Noah,</hi> and by a second fuller edition at his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) a free Pardon of the destructive punishment (but not of all punishment) with right to his Spirit of Grace, Adoption and Glory, in Union with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self their Head, on Condition initially of Faith and Repentance, and progressively of sincere Obedience to the end, to be performed by his Help or Grace.</p>
                     <p>§ 22. By this Law of Grace (supposing the Law of lapsed nature aforesaid, inclusively) all the World is ruled, and shall be judged, according to that edition of it (to <hi>Adam</hi> or by Christ) which they are under. And by it they shall be Justified or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>§ 23. If the question then be, Have you kept or not kept the Conditions of the Law of Grace, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Performance or nothing must so far be our Righteousness, and not Christs keeping them for us, or Satisfaction for our not keeping them. And this is the great Case (so oft by Christ described <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to be decided in judgment; and therefore the word <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> are used for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61305:59"/> what is thus personal hundreds of times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>§ 24. But as to the question, <hi>Have we kept</hi> the <hi>Law of Innocency?</hi> we must confess guilt and say, No: neither Immediately by our selves, nor Mediately by another, or Instrument: for <hi>Personal Obedience</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the performance required by that Law; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no <hi>Righteousness</hi> consisting in such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance or Innocency; but must confess sin, and plead a pardon.</p>
                     <p>§ 25. Therefore no man hath a proper <hi>Ʋniversal Righteousness,</hi> excluding all kind of Guilt whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>§ 26. Therefore no man is justified by the Law of Innocency (nor the Law Mosaical as of works;) either by the Preceptive or Retributive part: for we broke the Precept, and are by the Threatning heirs of death.</p>
                     <p>§ 27. That Law doth not justifie us, because Christ fulfilled it for us: For it said not (in words or sense) [Thou or one for thee shall <hi>Perfectly Obey,</hi> or <hi>Suffer:]</hi> It mentioned no Substitute: But it is the Law-giver (and not that Law) that justifieth us by other means.</p>
                     <p>§ 28. But we have <hi>another Righteousness imputed</hi> to us <hi>instead of that Perfect Legal Innocency</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardableness,</hi> by which we shall be <hi>accepted of God,</hi> and <hi>glorified</hi> at last as surely and fully (at least) as if we had never sinned, or had perfectly kept that Law; which therefore may be called our <hi>Pro-legal Righteousness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 29. But this Righteousness is not yet either OURS by such a propriety as a Personal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance would have bin, nor OURS to all the same
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61305:60"/> ends and purposes: It saveth us not from all pain, death or penal desertion, nor constituteth our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion just the same.</p>
                     <p>§ 30. It is the Law of Grace that Justifieth us, both as giving us Righteousness, and as <hi>Virtually judging</hi> us Righteous when it hath made us so, and it is Christ as Judg according to that Law (and God by Christ) that will <hi>sentence</hi> us just, and <hi>executively</hi> so use us.</p>
                     <p>§ 31. The Grace of Christ first giveth us <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> by effectual Vocation: And then the Law of Grace by its <hi>Donative</hi> part or Act doth give us a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Ʋnion</hi> with Christ as the Churches Head (and so to his Body) and with him a right to Pardon of past sin, and to the Spirit to dwell and act in us for the future, and to the Love of God, and Life eternal, to be ours in possession, if we sincerely obey and persevere.</p>
                     <p>§ 32. The total Righteousness then which we have (as an Accident of which we are the Subjects,) is 1. A right to Impunity, by the free Pardon of all our sins, and a right to Gods Favour and Glory, as a free gift <hi>quoad valorem,</hi> but as a <hi>Reward</hi> of our Obedience, <hi>quoad Ordinem conferendi &amp; rationem Comparativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>Relation</hi> of one that hath by grace performed the Condition of that free Gift, without which we had been no capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble recipients: which is initially [Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance] the Condition of our Right begun, and consequently, sincere Obedience and Perseverance (the Condition of continued right.)</p>
                     <p>§ 33. Christs personal Righteousness is no one of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, and so is not our <hi>Constitutive Righteousness</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61305:60"/> formally and strictly so called: For <hi>Formally</hi> our Righteousness is a <hi>Relation,</hi> (of right;) and it is the Relation of our own Persons: And a Relation is an accident: And the numerical Relation (or Right) of one person cannot be the same numerical Accident of another person as the subject.</p>
                     <p>§ 34. There are but three sorts of <hi>Causes; Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Constitutive,</hi> and <hi>Final.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Christ is the efficient cause of all our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: (1. Of our Right to Pardon and Life; 2. And of our Gospel-Obedience:) And that many waies: 1. He is the Meritorious Cause: 2. He is the <hi>Donor</hi> by his Covenant; 3. And the Donor or Operator of our Inherent Righteousness by his Spirit: 4. And the moral efficient by his Word, Promise, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And Christ is partly the final cause.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But all the doubt is whether his personal Righteousness be the <hi>Constitutive Cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 35. The <hi>Constitutive Cause</hi> of natural bodily substances consisteth of <hi>Matter disposed,</hi> and <hi>Form.</hi> Relations have no <hi>Matter,</hi> but instead of <hi>Matter</hi> a <hi>Subject</hi> (and that is <hi>Our own persons</hi> here, and not Christ.) and a <hi>terminus</hi> and <hi>fundamentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 36. The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> may be called both the <hi>Efficient Cause</hi> of the <hi>Relation</hi> (as commonly it is) and the <hi>Matter</hi> from which it <hi>resulteth:</hi> And so Christs Righteousness is undoubtedly the <hi>Meritorious</hi> efficient Cause, and undoubtedly not the <hi>Formal</hi> Cause of our personal Relation of Righteousness: Therefore all the doubt is of the Material Cause.</p>
                     <p>§ 37. So that all the Controversie is come up to a bare <hi>name</hi> and Logical term; of which Logicians agree not as to the aptitude. All confess that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61305:61"/> have no proper <hi>Matter,</hi> besides the subject: all confess that the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> is <hi>loco efficientis,</hi> but whether it be a fit name to call it the <hi>Constitutive Matter</hi> of a Relation, there is no agreement.</p>
                     <p>§ 38. And if there were, it would not decide this Verbal Controversie: For 1. <hi>Titulus est funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Juris:</hi> The <hi>fundamentum</hi> of our <hi>Right to Impunity and Life</hi> in and with Christ, is the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act</hi> of our Saviour in and by his Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: that is our <hi>Title;</hi> And from that our Relation resulteth, the <hi>Conditio tituli vel juris</hi> being found in our selves. 2. And our Relation of <hi>Performers</hi> of that Condition of the Law of Grace, resulteth from our own performance as the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> (compared to the Rule.) So that both these parts of our Righteousness have a nearer <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi> than Christs personal Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>§ 39. But the <hi>Right</hi> given us by the Covenant (and the Spirit and Grace) being a Right merited first by Christs personal Righteousness, this is a <hi>Causa Causae, id est, fundamenti, seu Donationis:</hi> And while this much is certain, whether it shall be called a <hi>Remote fundamentum (viz. Causa funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti)</hi> and so a Remote Constitutive Material Cause, or only (properly) a Meritorious Cause, may well be left to the arbitrary Logician, that use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such notions as he pleases; but verily is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie unfit to tear the Church for, or destroy Love and Concord by.</p>

                     <p>Let him that will answer me, keep to my words, and not alter the sense by leaving any out. And that he may the better understand me, I add, 1. I take it for granted that the Law requireth Habitual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness as well as Actual Obedience, and is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled without both. 2. That Christ loved God and man with a perfect constant Love, and never sinned by Omission or Commission. 3. That Christ died not only for our Original sin, or sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conversion, but for all our sin to our lives end. 4. That he who is supposed to have no sin of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, is supposed to have done all his duty. 5. That he that hath done all his duty, is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by that Law, yea hath right to all the Reward promised on Condition of that duty. 6. By Christs Material Righteousness, I mean, those Habits, Acts and Sufferings in which his Righteousness did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or was founded. 7. By his and our <hi>Formal Righteousness,</hi> I mean the <hi>Relation</hi> it self of being <hi>Righteous.</hi> 8. And I hold that Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, did not only <hi>Numerically</hi> (as aforesaid) but also thus <hi>totâ specie,</hi> in kind differ from ours, that his was a <hi>perfect Habitual and Actual Conformity to the</hi>

                        <hi>Law of Innocency, together with the peculiar Laws of Mediator-ship, by which he merited Redemption for us, and Glory for himself and us: But ours is the Pardon of sin, and Right to Life, Purchased, Merited and freely given us by Christ in and by a new Covenant, whose condition is Faith with Repentance, as to the gift of our Justification now, and sincere Holiness, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Victory and Perseverance as to our possession of Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now our Reasons against the denyed sence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation are these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In general this opinion setteth up and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all Antinomianism or Libertinism, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, and subverteth the Gospel and all true Religion and Morality.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean that all that hold it, have such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in themselves, but only that this is the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and consequence of the opinion: For I know that many see not the nature and consequences of their own opinions, and the abundance that hold damnable errors, hold them but notionally in a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish faction, and therefore not dammingly, but hold practically and effectually the contrary saving truth. And if the Papists shall perswade Men that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yea theirs that here mistake, cannot consist with a godly life, let but the lives of Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants be compared. Yea in one of the Instances before given; Though some of the Congregational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party hold what was recited, yet so far are they from ungodly lives, that the greatest thing in which I differ from them is, the overmuch unscriptural strictness of some of them, in their Church-admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Communion, while they fly further from such as they think not godly, than I think God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61305:64"/> would have them do, being generally persons fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God themselves: (Excepting the sinful aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others, and easiness to receive and carry false reports of Dissenters, which is common to all that fall into sidings.) But the errors of any men are never the better if they be found in the hands of godly men: For if they be practised they will make them ungodly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It confoundeth the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> and of the <hi>Sinner:</hi> As if the Mediator who was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Beloved of the Father, and therefore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reconciling us to him, because he was still <hi>well-pleased</hi> in him, had (not only suffered in the room of the sinner by voluntary Sponsion, but also) in suffering and doing, been <hi>Civilly</hi> the very person of the sinner himself; that sinner I say, who was an enemy to God, and so esteemed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It maketh Christ to have <hi>been Civilly</hi> as <hi>many persons</hi> as there be elect sinners in the World: which is both beside and contrary to Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It introduceth a false sence and supposition of our sin imputed to Christ, as if Imputatively it were his as it is ours, even the <hi>sinful Habits,</hi> the <hi>sinful Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>evil, Wicked, Ʋngodly</hi> and <hi>Ʋnrighteous</hi> which resulteth from them: And so it maketh Christ really <hi>hated of God:</hi> For God cannot but <hi>hate</hi> any one whom he reputeth to be truly ungodly, a Hater of God, an Enemy to him, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, as we all were: whereas it was only the Guilt of Punishment, and not of <hi>Crime,</hi> as such that Christ assumed: He undertook to suffer in the room of sinners; and to be reputed one that had so underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; But not to be reputed really a sinner, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly person, hater of God, one that had the Image of the Devil.</p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61305:64"/> 5. Nay it maketh Christ to have been incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the worst man that ever was in the World by just reputation; and to have been by just impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation guilty of all the sins of all the Elect that ever lived, and reputed one of the Murderers of himself, and <hi>one</hi> of the Persecutors of his Church, or rather <hi>many:</hi> and the language that <hi>Luther</hi> used Catechre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically, to be strictly and properly true.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It supposeth a wrong sence of the Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sin to his posterity: As if we had been justly reputed <hi>persons existent</hi> in <hi>his person,</hi> and so in him to have been <hi>persons that commited the same sin;</hi> whereas we are only reputed to be <hi>now</hi> (not <hi>then) persons</hi> who have a <hi>Nature</hi> derived from him, which being then <hi>seminally only</hi> in him, deriveth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation an answerable <hi>Guilt</hi> of his sinful fact, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>natural Corruption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. It supposeth us to be Justifiable and Justified by the Law of Innocency, made to <hi>Adam,</hi> as it saith <hi>[Obey perfectly and Live.]</hi> As if we fulfilled it by Christ: which is not only an addition to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Contradiction. For it is only the Law or Covenant of Grace that we are Justified by.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It putteth, to that end, a false sence upon the Law of Innocency: For whereas it commandeth <hi>Personal Obedience,</hi> and maketh <hi>Personal</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>due</hi> to the offender: This supposeth the Law to say or mean <hi>[Either thou, or one for thee shall Obey;</hi> or, <hi>Thou shalt obey by thy self, or by another:</hi> And <hi>if thou sin thou shalt suffer by thy self, or by another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas the Law knew no Substitute or Vicar, no nor Sponsor; nor is any such thing said of it in the Scripture: so bold are men in their additions.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It falsly supposeth that we are not Judged and

                     <p n="10">10. It fathereth on God an erring judgment, as if he reputed, reckoned or accounted things to be what they are not, and us to have done what we did not. To repute Christ a Sponsor for sinners who undertook to obey in their natures, and suffer in their place and stead, as a Sacrifice to redeem them, is all just and true: And to repute <hi>us those</hi> for whom Christ did this. But to repute Christ to have been really and every one of us, or a sinner, or guilty of sin it self; or to repute us to have been ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually as Good as Christ was, or actually to have done what he did, either Naturally or Civilly and by Him as our substitute, and to repute us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by possessing his formal personal Righteousness in it self; All these are untrue, and therefore not to be ascribed to God. To Impute it to us, is but to Repute us as verily and groundedly Righteous by his Merited and freely-Given Pardon, and Right to Life, as if we had merited it our selves.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It feigneth the same Numerical Accident [their <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>Righteousness]</hi> which was in one subject to be in another, which is Impossible.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It maketh us to have satisfied Divine Justice for our selves, and merited Salvation (and all that we receive) for our selves, in and by another: And so that we may plead our own Merits with God for Heaven and all his benefits.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The very making and tenor of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, contradicteth this opinion: For when God maketh a Law or Covenant, to convey the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Christs Righteousness to us, by degrees and upon certain Conditions, this proveth that the very
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61305:66"/> Righteousness in it self simply was not ours: else we should have had these effects of it both presently and immediately and absolutely without new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. This opinion therefore maketh this Law of Grace, which giveth the benefits to us by these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and upon terms, to be an <hi>injury</hi> to Believers, as keeping them from their own.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. It seemeth to deny Christs Legislation in the Law of Grace, and consequently his Kingly Office. For if we are reputed to have fulfilled the whole Law of Innocency in Christ, there is no business for the Law of Grace to do.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. It seemeth to make internal Sanctification by the Spirit needless, or at least, as to one half of its use: For if we are by just Imputation in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count perfectly Holy, in Christs Holiness the first moment of our believing, nothing can be added to Perfection; we are as fully <hi>Amiable</hi> in the fight of God, as if we were sanctified in our selves; Because by Imputation it is all our own.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And so it seemeth to make our after-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unnecessary, at least as to half its use: For if in Gods true account, we have perfectly obeyed to the death by another, how can we be required to do it all or part again by our selves? If all the debt of our Obedience be paid, why is it required again?</p>
                     <p n="18">18. And this seemeth to Impute to God a nature less holy and at enmity to sin, than indeed he hath; if he can repute a man laden with hateful sins, to be as perfecty Holy, Obedient and Amiable to him as if we were really so in himself, because another is such for him.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. If we did in our own persons Imputatively
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61305:67"/> what Christ did, I think it will follow that we <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi> that being unlawful to us which was Good in him. It is a sin for us to be Circumcised, and to keep all the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and send forth Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and to make Church-Ordinances needful to Salvation. Therefore we did not this in Christ: And if not this, they that distinguish and tell us what we did in Christ, and what not, must prove it. I know that Christ did somewhat which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty of all men, and somewhat proper to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and somewhat proper to himself: But that one sort of men did one part in Christ, and another sort did another part in him, is to be proved.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. If Christ suffered but in the Person of sinful man, his sufferings would have been in vain, or no Satisfaction to God: For sinful man is obliged to perpetual punishment; of which a temporal one is but a small part: <hi>Our persons</hi> cannot make a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral suffering equal to that perpetual one due to man: but the transcendent person of the Mediator did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> Christ bore both his own person and ours: It belongeth to him as Mediator to personate the guilty sinner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> It belongeth to him as Mediator to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the sinners punishment in his own person. And if any will improperly call that, the <hi>Personating and Representing</hi> of the <hi>sinner,</hi> let them limit it, and confess that it is not <hi>simply,</hi> but <hi>in tantum,</hi> so far, and to such uses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d no other, and that yet <hi>sinners did it not in</hi> and <hi>by Christ,</hi> but only Christ for them to convey the benefits as he pleased; And then we delight not to quarrel about more words; though we like the phrase of Scripture better than theirs.</p>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61305:67"/> 21. If Christ was perfectly Holy and Obedient in our persons, and we in him, then it was either in the Person of Innocent man before we sinned, or of sinful man. The first cannot be pretended: For man as Innocent had not a Redeemer. If of <hi>sinful man,</hi> then his perfect Obedience could not be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of our Salvation: For it supposeth him to do it in the person of a sinner: and he that hath once sinned, according to that Law, is the Child of death, and uncapable of ever fulfilling a Law, which is fulfilled with nothing but sinless perfect perpetual Obedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> He first suffered in our stead and persons as sinners, and then our sin being pardoned, he after in our persons fulfilled the Law, instead of our after-Obedience to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Christs Obedience to the Law was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death. 2. The sins which he suffered for, were not only before Conversion, but endure as long as our lives: Therefore if he fulfilled the Law in our persons after we have done sinning, it is in the persons only of the dead. 3. We are still obliged to Obedience our selves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But yet though there be no such difference in Time, God doth first Impute his sufferings to us for pardon of all our sins to the death, and in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his Obedience after it, as the Merit of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. God doth Impute or Repute his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the satisfying cause of our Pardon, and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Suffering and the rest of his Holiness and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as the meritorious cause of our <hi>Pardon</hi> and our Justification and Glory without dividing them. But 2. that implyeth that we did not our selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61305:68"/> do all this in Christ: As shall be further proved.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Their way of Imputation of the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ, overthroweth their own doctrine of the Imputation of his Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For if all sin be fully pardoned by the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Satisfaction, then sins of <hi>Omission</hi> and of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Privation and Corruption are pardoned; and then the whole punishment both of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Loss</hi> is remitted: And he that hath no sin of Omission or Privation, is a perfect doer of his duty, and holy; and he that hath no punishment of Loss, hath title to Life, according to that Covenant which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to have perfectly obeyed. And so he is an heir of life, without any Imputed Obedience upon the pardon of all his Disobedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> must have obeyed to the Death if he would have Life eternal: Therefore the bare pardon of his sins did not procure his right to life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True, if you suppose that only his first sin was pardoned: But 1. <hi>Adam</hi> had right to heaven as long as he was sinless. 2. Christ dyed for all <hi>Adams</hi> sins to the last breath, and not for the first only: And so he did for all ours. And if all the sins of omission to the death be pardoned, Life is due to us as righteous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> A Stone may be sinless, and yet not righteous nor have Right to life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True: because it is not a capable subject. But a man cannot be sinless, but he is Righteous, and hath right to life by Covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But not to punish is one thing and to Reward is another?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> They are distinct formal Relations and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61305:68"/> But where <hi>felicity is a Gift</hi> and called a <hi>Reward</hi> only for the <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of Collation, and where <hi>Innocency</hi> is the same with <hi>perfect Duty,</hi> and is the title-Condition; there to be punished is to be <hi>denyed</hi> the <hi>Gift,</hi> and to be <hi>Rewarded</hi> is to have the <hi>Gift</hi> as qualified persons: and not to <hi>Reward,</hi> is materially to <hi>punish;</hi> and to be reputed innocent is to be reputed a Meriter. And it is impossible that the most Innocent man can have any thing from God, but by way of free-Gift as to the <hi>Thing</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; however it may be merited in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paternal Justice as to the <hi>Order</hi> of donation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But there is a greater Glory merited by Christ, than the Covenant of works promised to man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That's another matter, and belongeth not to Justification, but to Adoption. 2. Christs Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as well as his Obedience, considered as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, did purchase that greater Glory. 3. We did not purchase or merit it in Christ, but Christ for us.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Their way of Imputation seemeth to me to leave no place or possibility for Pardon of sin, or at least of no sin after Conversion. I mean, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their opinion who think that we fulfilled the Law in Christ as we are elect from eternity, it leaveth no place for any pardon: And according to their opinion who say that we fulfilled it in him as <hi>Believers,</hi> it leaveth no place for pardon of any sin after Faith. For where the Law is reputed perfectly fulfilled (in Habit &amp; Act) there it is reputed that the person hath no sin. We had no sin before we had a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if we are reputed to have perfectly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ from our first Being, we are reputed sinless. But if we are reputed to have obeyed in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61305:69"/> him only since our believing, then we are reputed to have no sin since our Believing. Nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth sin, if perfect Habitual and Actual Holiness and Obedience do not.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. And consequently Christs blood shed and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made vain, either as to all our lives, or to all after our first believing.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. And then no believer must confess his sin, nor his desert of punishment nor repent of it, or be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. And then all prayer for the pardon of such sin is vain, and goeth upon a false supposition, that we have sin to pardon.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. And then no man is to be a partaker of the Sacrament as a Conveyance or Seal of such pardon; nor to believe the promise for it.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Nor is it a duty to <hi>give thanks</hi> to God or Christ for any such pardon.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="30">30. And then those in Heaven praise Christ in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when they magnifie him that washed them from such sins in his blood.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. And it would be no lie to say that we have no sin, at least, since believing.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Then no believer should <hi>fear sinning,</hi> because it is <hi>Impossible</hi> and a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> for the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be perfectly innocent to the death, and yet a sinner.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Then the Consciences of believers have no work to do, or at least, no examining, convincing, self-accusing and self-judging work.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. This chargeth God by Consequence of wronging all believers whom he layeth the least pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61305:69"/> upon: For he that hath perfectly obeyed, or hath perfectly satisfied, by himself or by another in his person, cannot justly be punished. But I have elsewhere fully proved, that Death and other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements are punishments, though not destructive, but corrective: And so is the permission of our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinning.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. It intimateth that God wrongeth believers, for not giving them immediately more of the Holy Ghost, and not present perfecting them and freeing them from all sin: For though Christ may give us the fruits of his own merits in the time and way that pleaseth himself; yet if it be <hi>we our selves</hi> that have perfectly satisfied and <hi>merited in Christ,</hi> we have present Right to the thing merited thereupon, and it is an injury to deny it us at all.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. And accordingly it would be an injury to keep them so long out of Heaven, if they themselves did merit it so long ago.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. And the very <hi>Threatning</hi> of Punishment in the Law of Grace would seem injurious or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, to them that have already reputatively obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly to the death.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. And there would be no place left for any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from God, to any act of obedience done by our selves in our natural or real person: Because having reputatively fulfilled all Righteousness, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that we are capable of by another, our own acts can have no reward.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. And I think this would overthrow all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws and Government: For all true Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are the Officers of God, and do what they do in subordination to God; and therefore cannot
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61305:70"/> justly punish any man, whom he pronounceth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Innocent to the death.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. This maketh every believer (at least) as Righteous as Christ himself, as having true propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in all the same numerical Righteousness as his own. And if we be as Righteous as Christ, are we not as amiable to God? And may we not go to God in our Names as Righteous?</p>
                     <p n="41">41. This maketh all believers (at least) <hi>equally Righteous</hi> in degree, and every one <hi>perfect,</hi> and no difference between them. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> as Righteous in the act of sinning as before, and every weak and scandalous believer, to be as Righteous as the best. Which is not true, though many say that Justification hath no degrees, but is perfect at first; as I have proved in my <hi>Life of Faith</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. This too much levelleth Heaven and Earth; For in Heaven there can be nothing greater than perfection.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. The Scripture no-where calleth our Imputed Righteousness by the name of Innocency, or sinless Perfection, nor Inculpability Imputed. Nay when the very phrase of <hi>Imputing Christs</hi> Righteousness is not there at all, to add all these wrong descriptions of Imputation, is such Additions to Gods words as tendeth to let in almost any thing that mans wit shall excogitate, and ill beseemeth them, that are for Scripture-sufficiency and perfection, and against Additions in the general. And whether some may not say that we are Imputatively Christ himself, Conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, Crucified, &amp;c. I cannot tell.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61305:70"/>
                     <p> To conclude, the honest plain Christian may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disquieting the Church or himself, be satisfied in this certain simple truth; That we are sinners and deserve everlasting misery: That Christ hath suffered as a Sacrifice for our sins in our room and stead, and satisfied the Justice of God: That he hath by his perfect Holiness and Obedience with those sufferings, merited our pardon and life: That he never hereby intended to make us Lawless or have us Holy, but hath brought us under a Law of Grace: which is the Instrument by which he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, justifieth and giveth us Right to life: That by this Covenant he requireth of us Repentance and true Faith to our first Justification, and sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Holiness and Perseverance to our Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be wrought by his Grace and our Wills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and enabled by it: That Christs Sufferings are to save us from suffering; but his Holiness and Obedience are to merit Holiness, Obedience &amp; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness for us, that we may be like him, and so be made personally amiable to God: But both his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Obedience, do bring us under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where Perfection is not necessary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The distinction of a <hi>Person</hi> into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> or <hi>Legal,</hi> is <hi>equivoci in sua equivocata:</hi> He therefore that would not have contention che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and men taught to damn each other for a word not understood, must give us leave to ask what these equivocals mean. What a <hi>Natural Person</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, we are pretty well agreed; but a <hi>Political Person</hi> is a word not so easily and commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us that <hi>Persona definitur homo qui caput habet civile.</hi> (For <hi>omnis persona est homo, sed non vicissim: Homo cum est vocabulum naturae; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona juris civilis.)</hi> And so (as <hi>Albenius) civitas, municipium, Castrum, Collegium, Ʋniversitas, &amp; quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet corpus, Personae appellatione continetur; ut Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi>
                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61305:71"/> But if this Definition be commensurate to the common nature of a civil person, then a King can be none; nor any one that hath not a <hi>civil head.</hi> This therefore is too narrow. The same <hi>Calvin (in n. Personae)</hi> tells us, that <hi>Seneca Personam vocat, cum prae se fert aliquis, quod non est;</hi> A Counterfeit: But sure this is not the sence of the Objectors. In general saith <hi>Calvin, Tam hominem quam qualitatem hominis, seu Conditionem significat.</hi> But it is not sure every <hi>Quality</hi> or <hi>Condition: Calvin</hi> therefore giveth us nothing satisfactory, to the decision of the Controversie which these Divines will needs make, whether each believer and Christ be the same Political Person. <hi>Martinius</hi> will make our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie no easier by the various significations gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Vet. Vocab. Gel. Scaliger, Valla;</hi> Which he thus enumerateth. 1. <hi>Persona est accidens condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio hominis, qualitas quâ homo differt ab homine, tum in animo, tum in corpore, tum in externis.</hi> 2. <hi>Homo qualitate dictâ proditus:</hi> 3. <hi>Homo insigni qualitate praeditus habens gradum eminentiae, in Ecclesta Dei, &amp;c.</hi> 4. <hi>Figura, seu facies ficta, larva histrionica, &amp;c.</hi> 5. <hi>Ille qui sub hujusmodi figura aliquam representat, &amp;c.</hi> 6. <hi>Figura eminens in aedificiis quae ore aquam fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp;c. Individua substantia humana, seu singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris homo.</hi> 8. <hi>Individua substantia Intelligens quaelibet.</hi> Now which of these is <hi>Persona Politica vel Legalis.</hi> Let us but agree what we mean by the word and I suppose we shall find that we are agreed of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When I deny the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to have been the same, or to be so reputed by God, I mean by <hi>Person,</hi> univocally or properly, An <hi>Individual Intelligent substance.</hi> And they that mean otherwise are obliged to Define; For <hi>Analogum per</hi>
                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61305:72"/>
                           <hi>se positum stat pro suo significato famosiore.</hi> If they mean that Christ and the Believer are the same as to some <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> let them tell us what Quality or Condition it is, and I think we shall be found to be of one mind.</p>
                        <p>But I think by the similitudes of a <hi>Sponsor, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and <hi>Guardian,</hi> that they mean by a <hi>Political Person</hi> (not as a <hi>society,</hi> nor such as agree <hi>in Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but) <hi>A natural Person so related to another Natural person, as that what he doth and suffereth, Is or Hath, is limitedly to certain ends and uses as effectual as if that other person himself did and suffered, Were or Had numerically the same thing.</hi> I obtrude not a sense on others, but must know theirs before I can know where we differ. And if this be the meaning, we are agreed: Thus far (though I greatly dislike their way that lay much stress on such humane phrases,) I grant the thing meant by them. Christs Holiness Habitual and Actual, and his Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are as effectual to a believers Justification and Salvation upon the terms of the Covenant of Grace (which is sealed by baptism) as if we had been, done and suffered the same our selves. But still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that this is only <hi>[limitedly]</hi> to <hi>these uses,</hi> and on these <hi>termes</hi> and no other, and I think that this is the meaning of most Divines that use this phrase.</p>
                        <p>But the sense of those men that I differ from and write against (the <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and some others that own not those names,) is this: that <hi>A Legal Person is one so Related to anothers Natural person as that what he Hath, Doth, or Suffereth in such a case,</hi> is (not only effectual as aforesaid to others, but) <hi>is in itself simply Reputed or Imputed to be Morally, though not physically, the Habit, Act and</hi>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:61305:72"/>
                           <hi>Suffering, the Merit and satisfactory Sacrifice of the other person: And so being the reputed Haver, Doer</hi> or <hi>Sufferer, Meriter</hi> or <hi>Satisfyer himself, he hath abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right to all the proper results or benefits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so a man may indeed many ways among us <hi>Represent</hi> or <hi>Personate</hi> another. If I by Law am Commanded to do this or that service <hi>per meipsum aut per alium,</hi> I do it in the Moral or Law-sence, because the other doth it in my name and I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed so to do it. So if I appear or answer by any Proctor or Attorney; if the Law make it equal to my personal appearance and answer, it is said that <hi>I did it by him:</hi> (but only so far as he doth it as my <hi>Representer</hi> or <hi>in my name):</hi> So if I pay a debt by the hand of <hi>my Servant</hi> or any Messenger, if so allowed, I do it by that other. So indeed a Pupil, doth by his Guardian what his Guardian doth, only so far as the Law obligeth him to consent or stand to it.</p>
                        <p>We did not thus our selves fulfil all the Law in and by Christ: Nor are we <hi>thus</hi> the <hi>Proprietors</hi> of his <hi>Habitual</hi> perfection, <hi>Merits or Satisfaction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The common reason given by the contrary-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, that he was our <hi>Surety,</hi> or <hi>Sponsor,</hi> or <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jussor:</hi> and so we translate <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61305:74"/> who (because many parents <hi>Apostatized,</hi> and more <hi>Died</hi> in the Childs minority) did pass his word, 1. <hi>That the Parent was a credible Person,</hi> 2. That if he <hi>Dyed</hi> so soon or <hi>Apostatized,</hi> he himself would undertake the Christian Education of the Child. But the <hi>Parent</hi> himself was <hi>Sponsor for the Child</hi> in a stricter sense, (as also Adopting Pro-parents were, &amp; as some take God-fathers to be now,) that is, they were taken for such, whose Reason, will and word, we authorised to dispose of the Child as obligingly, as if it had been done by his own reason will and word, so be it, it were but <hi>For his good,</hi> and the Child did own it when he came to age: And so they were to speak as in the Childs name, as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Charity made them his Representers, in the Judgment of many. (Though others rather think that they were to speak as in their own persons, <hi>e. g.</hi> I dedicate this Child to God, and enter him into the Covenant as obliged by my Consent.) But this sense of <hi>Sponsion</hi> is nothing to the present Case.</p>

It's another thing to undertake that he shall suffer a penalty, or else to suffer for him, or make a Valuable Compensation.</p>
                        <p>1. And it's one kind of Surety that becometh a

                           <hi>second party in the bond,</hi> and so maketh <hi>himself a debtor;</hi> 2. And its another sort of Surety that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh only the Debt afterward voluntarily as a Friend;</hi> who may pay it on such Conditions as he and the Creditor think meet, without the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors knowledg. Every Novice that will but open <hi>Calvin</hi> may see that <hi>Fidejussor</hi> and <hi>Sponsor</hi> are words of very various signification; and that they seldom or never signifie the <hi>Person Natural</hi> or <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> (as you call it) of the <hi>Principal: Sponsor est qui sponte &amp; non rogatus pro alio promittit, ut Accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel quicunque spondet, maximè pro aliis: Fidejube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re est suo periculo fore id, de quo agitur, recipere: Vel, fidem suam pro alio obligare.</hi> He is called <hi>Adpromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> and he is <hi>Debtor,</hi> but not the same <hi>person</hi> with the <hi>Principal,</hi> but his promise is <hi>accessoria obligatio, non principalis.</hi> Therefore <hi>Fidejussor sive Intercessor non est conveniendus, nisi prius debitore principali convento: Fidejussores a correis ita differunt, quod hi suo &amp; proprio morbo laborant, illi vero alieno tenentur: Quare fideijussori magis succurrendum censent: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niâ namque digni sunt qui alienâ tenentur Culpâ, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi sunt fidejussores pro alieno debito obligati, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit</hi> Calv.</p>

                        <p>But seeing <hi>Legal-Personality</hi> is but a <hi>Relation</hi> of our <hi>Natural person,</hi> to another <hi>Natural person,</hi> that we may not quarrel and tear the Church when really
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61305:75"/> we differ not 1. Let our agreement be noted. 2. Our difference intelligibly stated.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is granted (not only by <hi>Dr. Tullie,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that accurately handle the Controversie,) 1. That Christ and the Believer never were nor are our Natural person; and that no union with him maketh us to be Christ, or God, nor him to be <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, John</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. That we know of no third sort of <hi>Natural person,</hi> (which is neither Jesus, nor <hi>Peter, John,</hi> &amp;c.) But composed of both united, which is constituted by our Union. For though it be agreed on, that the same Spirit that is in Christ is (operatively) also in all his Members, and that therefore our <hi>Communion</hi> with him is more than <hi>Relative,</hi> and that from this <hi>Real-Communion,</hi> the name of a <hi>Real-Ʋnion</hi> may be used; yet here the <hi>Real-Ʋnion</hi> is not <hi>Personal</hi> (as the same Sun quickeneth and illuminateth a Bird and a Frog and a Plant, and yet maketh them not our person:) Therefore he that will say we are <hi>Physically</hi> one with Christ, and not only Relatively; but tell us <hi>[ONE What?]</hi> and make his words Intelligible; and must deny that we are <hi>ONE PERSON:</hi> and that by that time we are not like to be found differing. But remember that while <hi>Physical Communion,</hi> is confessed by all, what <hi>ƲNION</hi> we shall from thence be said to have (this Foundation being agreed on) is like to prove but a question, <hi>de realitione &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Yea all the world must acknowledg that the whole Creation is <hi>quoad praesentiam &amp; derivationem</hi> more dependant on God than the fruit is on the <hi>Tree,</hi> or the Tree on the Earth, and that God is the inseperate Cause of our <hi>Being, Station, and Life;</hi>
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61305:75"/> And yet this natural intimateness, and influx, and causality, maketh not GOD and every Creature absolutely or personally <hi>One.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is agreed therefore that <hi>Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is neither <hi>materially</hi> nor <hi>formally,</hi> any <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of our <hi>natural Persons;</hi> (and an <hi>Accident</hi> it is) <hi>unless</hi> it can be reduced to that of <hi>Relation.</hi> 1. The <hi>Habits</hi> of our Person, cannot possibly be the habits of another inherently. 2. The <hi>actions</hi> of one <hi>cannot</hi> possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the <hi>actions</hi> of another, as the Agent, unless as that other as a <hi>principal Cause,</hi> acteth by the other as his <hi>Instrument</hi> or second Cause. 3. The same <hi>fundamentum relationis</hi> inherent in One Person, is not inherent in another if it be a personal Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And so the same individual Relation that is one Mans, cannot numerically be another Mans, by the same sort of in-being, propriety, or adherence. Two Brothers have a Relation in <hi>kind the same,</hi> but not <hi>unmerically.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. And it is agreed that God judgeth not falsly, and therefore taketh not Christ's Righteousness to be any more or otherwise <hi>ours,</hi> than indeed it is; nor imputeth it to us erroneously.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Yet it is commonly agreed, that <hi>Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> is <hi>OƲRS</hi> in some sense; And so far is justly <hi>reputed Ours,</hi> or <hi>imputed</hi> to us as being <hi>Ours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And this ambiguous syallable <hi>[OƲRS]</hi> (enough to set another Age of Wranglers into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Church-tearing strife, if not hindred by some that will call them to explain an ambiguous word) is it that must be understood to end this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. <hi>Propriety</hi> is the thing signified. 1. In the strictest sense that is called <hi>Ours,</hi> which inhereth in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61305:76"/> us, or that which is <hi>done</hi> by us. 2. In a larger (Moral) sense, that which a Man as the <hi>principal Cause,</hi> doth by another as his <hi>Instrument,</hi> by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing, commanding, perswading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. In a yet larger sense that may be called <hi>OƲRS,</hi> which a third person doth partly <hi>instead</hi> of what we should <hi>have done (had, or suffered)</hi> and partly for our <hi>use,</hi> or <hi>benefit.</hi> 4. In a yet larger sense that may be called <hi>OƲRS,</hi> which another <hi>hath,</hi> or <hi>doth,</hi> or <hi>suffereth</hi> for our <hi>Benefit,</hi> (though not in our stead) and which will be for our good, (as that which a Friend or Father hath, is his Friends or Childs, and <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>Ours,</hi> whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Godly are owners of the World, in as much as God <hi>will use all for</hi> their good).</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is therefore a <hi>Relation</hi> which Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness hath to us, or we to it, that must here be meant by the word <hi>[OƲRS]:</hi> Which is our <hi>RIGHT</hi> or <hi>Jus;</hi> And that is acknowledged to be no <hi>Jus</hi> or Right to it in the foresaid denied sense; And it is agreed that <hi>some Right</hi> it is. Therefore, to understand what it is, the <hi>Titulus seu Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum juris</hi> must be known.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And here it is agreed; 1. That we are before Conversion or Faith related to Christ as part of the Redeemed World, of whom it is said, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>That God was in Christ, reconciling the World to himself, not imputing to them their sins,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That we are after Faith related to Christ as his Covenanted People, Subjects, Brethren, Friends, and Political Members; yea, as such that have <hi>Right to,</hi> and <hi>Possession of</hi> Real Communion with him by his Spirit: And that we have then Right to <hi>Pardon,</hi> Justification, and Adoption, (or have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61305:76"/> Right to <hi>Impunity</hi> in the promised degree, and to the <hi>Spirits Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory).</hi> This Relation to <hi>Christ</hi> and this <hi>Right,</hi> to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of his <hi>Righteousness</hi> are agreed on: And consequently that his <hi>Righteousness</hi> is <hi>OƲRS,</hi> and so may be called, as far as the foresaid <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> import.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Now a Relation (as <hi>Ockam</hi> hath fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) having no real entity, beside the <hi>quid absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which is the <hi>Subject, Fundamentum,</hi> or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> he that yet raileth at his Brother as not say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough, or not being herein so wise as he, and will maintain that yet <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>OƲRS,</hi> must name the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Propriety:</hi> What more is it that you mean? I think the make-bates have here little probability of fetching any more Fuel to their Fire, or turning Christ's Gospel into an occasion of strife and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enmity, If they will but be driven to a distinct explication, and will not make <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous</hi> words their defence and weapons. If you set your quarrelsome Brains on work, and study as hard as you can for matter of Contention, it will not be easie for you to find it, unless you will raze out the names of <hi>Popery, Socinianism, Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> or <hi>Solifidianism,</hi> Heresie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> instead of real Difference. But if the <hi>angriest</hi> and <hi>lowdest</hi> Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be in the right, <hi>Bedlam</hi> and <hi>Billingsgate</hi> may be the most Orthodox places.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, 1. The foresaid Benefits of Christ's Righteousness, (Habitual, Active and Passive) as a Meritorious, Satisfactory, Purchasing Cause, are ours.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61305:77"/> 2. To say that the Benefits are <hi>Ours,</hi> importeth that the <hi>Causal Righteousness</hi> of Christ is related to <hi>us, and the Effects</hi> as <hi>such a Cause:</hi> and so is it self <hi>OƲRS,</hi> in that sense, that is, so related.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And Christ himself is <hi>OƲRS,</hi> as related to us as our Saviour; the Procurer and Giver of those Benefits. And do you mean any more by <hi>[OƲRS]?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you say that we deny any <hi>Benefits</hi> of Christ's Righteousness which you assert, name what they are. If you say that we deny any true <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum juris,</hi> or reason of our title, name what that is. If you say that we deny any true Relation to Christ himself, tell us what it is: If you cannot, say that you are agreed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If you say that the Benefit denied by us, is that we are judged by God, as those that (habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and actively) have perfectly fulfilled the Law of Innocency our selves, though not in our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Persons, yet by Christ as representing us, and so shall be justified by that Law of Innocency as the Fulfiller of it, we do deny it, and say, That you subvert the Gospel, and the true Benefits which we have by Christ.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If you say that we deny that God esteemeth or reputeth us, to be the very Subjects of that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Righteousness, in the Habits, Acts, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Relation, which was in the Person of Christ, or to have <hi>done, suffered,</hi> or <hi>merited our selves</hi> in and by him, as the proper Representer of our Persons therein; and so that his Righteousness is thus imputed to us as truly in it self <hi>our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi> we do deny it, and desire you to do so also, lest you deny Christianity.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61305:77"/> 2. If you blame us for saying, That we had or have no such Relation to Christ, as to our Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the proper full Representer of each Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular Person, by whom we did truly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law of Innocency, habitually and actively, and satisfied, merited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do still say so, and wish you to consider what you say, before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to say the contrary.</p>
                        <p>But if you come not up to this, where will you find a difference.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> And are we not all agreed of all this? But can his Righteousness be <hi>Ours</hi> no way but by the foresaid Personation Representating? How prove you that? He is <hi>Our Righteousness,</hi> and his <hi>Obedience maketh us Righteous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because the very Law of Innocency which we dishonoured and broke by sin, is perfectly fulfilled and honoured by him, as a Mediator, to repair the injury done by our breaking it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In that he suffered to satisfie Justice for our sin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In that hereby he hath merited of God the Father, all that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which we are truly the Subjects of, whether it be Relative, or Qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Active; that is, 1. Our Right to Christ in Union to the Spirit, to Impunity, and to Glory; And, 2. The Grace of the Spirit by which we are made Holy, and fulfil the Conditions of the Law
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61305:78"/> of Grace. We are the <hi>Subjects of these,</hi> and he is the <hi>Minister,</hi> and the <hi>meritorious Cause</hi> of our <hi>Life,</hi> is well called <hi>Our Righteousness,</hi> and by many the <hi>material Cause,</hi> (as our own perfect Obedience would have been) because it is the <hi>Matter</hi> of that Merit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And also Christ's Intercession with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, still procureth all this as the Fruit of his Merits.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And we are Related as his Members (though not parts of his <hi>Person</hi> as such) to him that thus merited for us.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And we have the Spirit from him as our Head.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And he is our Advocate, and will justifie us as our Judg.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And all this is <hi>God's Righteousness</hi> designed for us, and thus far given us by him.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And the perfect Justice and Holiness of God, is thus glorified in us through Christ.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61305:78"/> and how far it is <hi>OƲRS,</hi> and in that sense we are justified by it, and it is truly imputed to us, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or reckoned as <hi>OƲRS:</hi> But not in their sense that claim a strict Propriety in the same numerical Habits, Acts, Sufferings, Merits, Satisfaction, which was in Christ, or done by him, as if they did become <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>same Accidents;</hi> or, as if they did it by an instrumental second Cause. But it is <hi>OƲRS,</hi> as being done by a Mediator, instead of what we should have done, and as the Meritorious Cause of all our Righteousness and Benefits, which are freely given us for the sake hereof.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He that is made Righteousness to us, is also made Wisdom, Sanctification and Redemption to us: but that <hi>sub genere Causae Efficientis, non autem Causae Constitutivae:</hi> We are the Subjects of the same numerical <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> which is in Christ. Plainly the Question is, Whether Christ or his Righteousness, Holiness, Merits, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, be <hi>Our Righteousness Constitutively,</hi> or only <hi>Efficiently?</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of Christ's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Righteousness is <hi>OƲRS,</hi> as an Efficient Cause, but it is neither the nearest <hi>Matter,</hi> or the <hi>Form</hi> of that Righteousness which is <hi>OƲRS</hi> as the Subjects of it; that is, It is not a Constitutive Cause nextly material, or formal of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

You do seem to suppose that we have none of that kind of Righteousness at all, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in perfect Obedience and Holiness, but only a Right to Impunity and Life, with an imperfect Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteousness in our selves: The Papists are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confess, that a Righteousness we must have which consisteth in a conformity to the preceptive part of the Law, and not only the Retributive part: But they say, It is in our selves, and we say it is Christ's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Papists <hi>(e. g.</hi> Learned <hi>Vasquer</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.) talk so ignorantly of the differences of the Two Covenants, or the Law of Innocency and of Grace, as if they never understood it. And hence they 1. seem to take no notice of the Law of Innocency, or of Nature now commanding our perfect Obedience, but only of the Law of Grace. 2. Therefore they use to call those <hi>Duties</hi> but Perfections; and the Commands that require them, but <hi>Counsels,</hi> where they are not made Conditions of Life: and sins not bringing Damnation, some call Venial, (a name not unfit) and some expound that as properly <hi>no sin,</hi> but analogically. 3. And hence they take little notice, when they treat of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, of the <hi>Remitting of Punishment;</hi> but by <hi>remitting Sin,</hi> they usually mean the destroying the <hi>Habits:</hi> As if they forgot all <hi>actual sin past,</hi> or thought that it deserved no Punishment, or needed no Pardon: For a past Act in it self is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and is capable of no Remission but Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 4. Or when they do talk of Guilt of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, they lay so much of the Remedy on Man's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as if Christ's Satisfaction and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61305:79"/> Merits had procured no pardon, or at least, of no temporal part of Punishment. 5. And hence they ignorantly revile the Protestants, as if we denied all <hi>Personal Inherent Righteousness,</hi> and trusted only to the Imputation of Christ▪s Righteousness as justifying wicked unconverted Men: The Papists therefore say not that we are innocent or sinless, (really or imputatively); no not when they dream of <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> unless when they denominate <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> only from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Law of Grace, and not that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</p>

If by <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> be meant the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Sinner as he is <hi>Revera Peccator,</hi> and so to be <hi>Reus,</hi> is to be <hi>Revera ipse qui peccavit;</hi> then we must consider what you mean by <hi>Pardon:</hi> For if you mean the <hi>nullifying</hi> of such a <hi>Guilt,</hi> (or <hi>Reality)</hi> it is impossible, because <hi>necessiate existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> he that hath once sinned, will be still the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that sinned, while he is a Person, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>one that sinned</hi> will cleave to him: It will eternally be a true Proposition, <hi>[Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did sin]; But if by <hi>Pardon</hi> you mean, the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi> of all the <hi>penalty</hi> which for that sin is due, <hi>(damni vel sensus)</hi> so <hi>it is pardoned;</hi> and this is indeed the <hi>Reatus poenae:</hi> Not only the <hi>Penalty,</hi> but the <hi>Dueness</hi> of that Penalty, or the Obligation to it, is remitted and nullified.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Therefore if by <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> you mean an <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Punishment for that Fault,</hi> this being indeed the <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> as is said, is done away. So that we are, I think, all agreed <hi>de re;</hi> And <hi>de nomine</hi> you may say that the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> is done away or remitted, or not, in several senses: <hi>In se,</hi> it is not nullified, nor can be: But as <hi>Dueness</hi> of Punishment followeth, that is pardoned.</p>

You have said, That though we were not personally but seminally in <hi>Adam</hi> when he sinned, yet when we are Persons, we are Persons guilty of his actual sin: And so we must be Persons that are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Christ's Actual Righteousness, and not only of its Effects, as soon as we are Believers. For Christ being the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and publick Person, we have our part in his Righteousness, as truly and as much as in <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin.</p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61305:80"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We must first understand how far <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin is ours: And first I have elsewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that our <hi>Covenant-Ʋnion and Interest</hi> supposeth our <hi>Natural Ʋnion</hi> and <hi>Interest;</hi> and that it is an adding to God's Word and Covenant, to say, That he covenanted that <hi>Adam</hi> should personate each one of his Posterity in God's imputation or account, any further than they were naturally in him; and so that his <hi>innocency or sin</hi> should be reputed theirs, <hi>as far</hi> as if they had been personally the Subjects and Agents. The <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> never was in <hi>Reality</hi> or <hi>God's Reputation,</hi> the <hi>Person of</hi> Adam. (Nor <hi>Adam</hi>'s Person the Person of <hi>Peter):</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> being virtually and seminally in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he sinned, his Person is derived from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And so <hi>Peter</hi>'s Guilt is not numerically the same with <hi>Adams,</hi> but the Accident of another Subject, and therefore another Accident, derived with the Person from <hi>Adam</hi> (and from nearer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents). The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that <hi>Relation</hi> (of Guilt) is the <hi>Natural Relation</hi> of the Person to <hi>Adam,</hi> (and so it is <hi>Relatio in Relatione fundata).</hi> The <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of that <hi>natural Relation,</hi> is <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> yea a <hi>series</hi> of Generations from <hi>Adam</hi> to that Person: And <hi>Adam</hi>'s Generation being the Communication of a <hi>Guilty Nature with personality</hi> to his Sons and Daughters, is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> next following his <hi>personal Fault and Guilt</hi> charged on him by the Law: So that here is a long <hi>series</hi> of efficient Causes, bringing down from <hi>Adam's Person and Guilt</hi> a <hi>distinct numerical Person</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> of every one of his later Posterity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And it is not the same sort of Guilt, or so plenary, which is on us, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Act, as was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61305:81"/> on him, but a Guilt Analogical, or of another sort: that is, He was guilty of being the <hi>wilful sinning Person,</hi> and so are not we, but only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Persons whose Being is derived by Generation from the wilful sinning Persons,</hi> (besides the guilt of our own inherent pravity): That is, <hi>The Relation is such which our Persons have to</hi> Adam<hi>'s Person, as make it just with God to desert us, and to punish us for that and our pravity together.</hi> This is our <hi>Guilt</hi> of Original sin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And this Guilt cometh to us by Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and resultancy from our very Nature so propagated. And now let us consider of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Interest in Christ.</p>
                        <p>And, 1. Our Persons are not the same as Christ's Person, (nor Christ's as ours) nor ever so judged or accounted of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Persons</hi> were not naturally, seminally, and virtually in Christ's Person (any further than he is Creator and Cause of all things) as they were in <hi>Adams.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore we derive not Righteousness from him by Generation, but by his voluntary Donation or Contract.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As he became not our Natural Parent, so our Persons not <hi>being in Christ</hi> when he obeyed, are not <hi>reputed to have been in him naturally,</hi> or to have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and by him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If Christ and we are reputed one Person, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <hi>obeyed</hi> in our <hi>Person,</hi> or we <hi>in his,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi> If he <hi>obeyed</hi> as a <hi>Reputed Sinner</hi> in the Person of each Sinner, his Obedience could not be meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to the Law of Innocency, which required sinless Perfection; And he being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61305:81"/> to have broken the Law in our Persons, could not so be supposed to keep it. If we obeyed in his <hi>Person,</hi> we obeyed as <hi>Mediators,</hi> or Christ's, of which before.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But as is oft said, Christ our Mediator under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in a middle Person to reconcile God and Man, (not by bringing God erroneously to judg that he or we were what we are not, or did what we did not, but) by <hi>being, doing,</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> for us, that in <hi>his own Person,</hi> which should better answer God's Ends and Honour, than if we had done and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Persons, that hereby he might <hi>merit</hi> a free Gift of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> (with himself) to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a Law of Grace to believing penitent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepters. And so our Righteousness, as is oft open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a Relation resulting at once from all these Causes as fundamental to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteousness, his free Gift thereupon, and our Relation to him as Covenanters or United Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. And this is agreed on.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christ's Person was not the Subject of our personal Relative <hi>Guilt,</hi> much less of our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> or <hi>Acts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. God did not judg him to have been so.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Nay, Christ had no <hi>Guilt</hi> of the <hi>same kind</hi> reckoned to be on him; else those unmeet Speeches, used rashly by some, would be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ was the greatest Murderer, Adulterer, Idolater,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61305:82"/> Blasphemer, Thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently more hated of God, (for God must needs hate a sinner as such). To be guilty of sin as we are, is to be reputed truly to be the Person that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it: But so was not Christ, and therefore not so to be reputed. Christ was but the Mediator that undertook to suffer for our sins, that we might be forgiven; and not for his <hi>own</hi> sin, real or justly reputed: Expositors commonly say that to be <hi>[made sin for us],</hi> is but to be made <hi>[a Sacrifice for sin].</hi> So that Christ took upon him neither our <hi>numerical guilt</hi> of sin it self, nor any of the same <hi>species;</hi> but only our <hi>Reatum Poenae,</hi> or <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> or (lest the Wrangler make a verbal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of it) our <hi>Reatum Culpae non qua talem &amp; in se, sed quatenus est fundamentum Reatus poenae:</hi> And so his <hi>Righteousness</hi> is ours; not <hi>numerically</hi> the same Relation that he was the Subject of made that Relation to us; nor yet a <hi>Righteousness</hi> of the same <hi>Species</hi> as Christ's is given us at all, (for his was a <hi>Mediators Righteousness,</hi> consisting in, 1. <hi>perfect Innocency;</hi> 2. And that in the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Law,</hi> which bind us not; 3. And in doing his <hi>peculiar Works,</hi> as <hi>Miracles, Resurrection,</hi> &amp;c. which were all <hi>His Righteousness</hi> as a conformity to <hi>that Law,</hi> and performance of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was made with, and to him <hi>as Mediator).</hi> But his Righteousness is the <hi>Meritorious Cause</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of another Righteousness or Justification (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from his) freely given us by the Father and himself by his Covenant. So that here indeed the Similitude much cleareth the Matter; And they that will not blaspheme Christ by making <hi>guilt of sin it self</hi> in its <hi>formal Relation</hi> to be his own, and so
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61305:82"/> Christ to be <hi>formally</hi> as great a sinner as all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed set together, and they that will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Gospel, by making us formally as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as Christ in kind and measure, must needs be agreed with us in this part of the Controversie.</p>

When you infer, That if we are reckoned to have perfectly obeyed in and by Christ, we cannot be again bound to obey our selves afterward, nor be guilty of any sin; you must know that it's true, That we cannot be bound to obey to the same ends as Christ did, (which is to redeem us, or to fulfil the Law of Works) But yet we must obey to other ends, <hi>viz.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and to live to God, and to do good, and other such like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is very true, That we are not bound to obey to all the same ends that Christ did, as to redeem the World, nor to fulfil the Law of Innocency. But hence it clearly followeth that <hi>Christ obeyed not</hi> in each of our Persons legally, but in the Person of a Mediator, seeing his due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ours have so different <hi>Ends,</hi> and a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent formal Relation, (his being a conformity proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to the Law, given him as Mediator) that they are not so much as of the same <hi>species,</hi> much less numerically the same.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And this fully proveth that we are not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have perfectly obeyed in and by him: For else we could not be yet obliged to obey, though to other ends than he was: For either this <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>Gratitude</hi> is a Duty or not; If not, it is not truly <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor the omission sin: If yea, then <hi>that Duty</hi> was made a Duty by some Law: And if by a Law we are now bound to obey <hi>in gratitude</hi> (or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61305:83"/> for what ends soever) either we do all that we are so bound to do, or not. If we do it (or any of it) then to say that we did it twice, once by Christ, and once by our selves, is to say that we were bound to do it twice, and then Christ did not all that we were bound to, but half: But what Man is he that sinneth not? Therefore seeing it is certain, that no Man doth all that he is bound to do by the Gospel, (in the time and measure of his <hi>Faith, Hope, Love, Fruitfulness,</hi> &amp;c.) it followeth that he is a sinner, and that he is not supposed to have done all that by Christ which he failed in, both because he was bound to do it himself, and because he is a sinner for not doing it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yea, the Gospel binds us to that which Christ could not do for us, it being a Contradiction. Our great Duties are, 1. To believe in a Saviour. 2. To improve all the parts of his Mediation by a Life of Faith. 3. To repent of our sins. 4. To mortifie sinful Lusts in our selves. 5. To fight by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit against our flesh. 6. To confess our selves sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 7. To pray for pardon. 8. To pray for that Grace which we culpably want. 9. To love God for redeeming us. 10. Sacramentally to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Christ, and to receive him and his Gifts; with many such like; which Christ was not capable of doing in and on his own Person for us, though as Mediator he give us Grace to do them, and pray for the pardon of our sins, as in our selves.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But the Truth which this Objection intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, we all agree in, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Mediator per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly kept the Law of Innocency, that the keeping of that Law might not be necessary to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61305:83"/> (and so such Righteousness necessary in our selves) but that we might be pardoned for want of perfect Innocency, and be saved upon our sincere keeping of the Law of Grace, because the Law of Innocency was kept by our Mediator, and thereby the Grace of the New-Covenant merited, and by it Christ, Pardon, Spirit and Life, by him freely given to Believers.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Remember that you suppose here the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> to be the same Man: And then that the two contrary Relations of <hi>perfect Innocency,</hi> or <hi>guiltlesness,</hi> and <hi>guilt of any,</hi> (yea much sin) can be consistent in him, is a gross contradiction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he may be guilty, and not guilty in several partial respects; but a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>guiltlesness</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all guilt. But we are guilty of many a sin after Conversion, and need a Pardon. All that you should say is this, <hi>We are sinners our selves, but we have a Mediator that sinned not, who merited Pardon and Heaven for sinners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if you mean that God reputeth us to be perfectly innocent when we are not, because that Christ was so, it is to impute Error to God: He reputeth no Man to be otherwise than he is: But he doth indeed first give, and then impute a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness Evangelical to us, instead of perfect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which shall as certainly bring us to Glory; and that is, He giveth us both the Renovation of

                        <p>To speak freely, I remember not one Text of Scripture that useth the word <hi>[Justifie]</hi> in this Doctor's sense; that is, <hi>Only for the said absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Curse of the Law:</hi> For all those other Texts that speak for Justification by Christ's Grace, and Faith, <hi>and not by the Works of the Law,</hi> (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 24, 28, 30. and 4. 2, 5, 25. &amp; 5. 1, 9, 16, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16, 17. &amp; 3. 8, 11, 24. &amp; 5. 4, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> do all seem to me to mean, not only that [we are <hi>absolved from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law],</hi> but also that we are first <hi>made,</hi> and then accounted Persons first meet for Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and next meet for God's Acceptance of us as just, and as Heirs of Life Eternal, and meet for the great <hi>Reward in Heaven:</hi> For when the Apostle denieth <hi>Justification</hi> by <hi>Works;</hi> it is not credible that he meaneth only, that <hi>[By the Works of the Law no Man is absolved from the Curse of the Law];</hi> But also, <hi>No Man by the Works of the Law,</hi> is before God taken for a Performer of the necessary Condition of Absolution and Salvation, nor fit for his Acceptance, and for the Heavenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. But let the Reader here note, that the Doctor supposeth <hi>James</hi> to mean, that <hi>[By Works a Man is absolved from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law, and not by Faith only].</hi> For that <hi>James</hi> speaks of Justification <hi>in foro Dei</hi> is past all doubt: And who would have thought that the Doctor had granted this of the Text of <hi>James?</hi> But mistakes seldom agree among themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. And would not any Man have thought
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61305:87"/> that this Author had pleaded for such an Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ's Righteousness, as justifieth not only from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law, but also from the very guilt of sin as sin, we being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, (not only pardoned sinners, but) perfect fulfillers of the Law by Christ, and so that we are in Christ conform to the <hi>Fac hoc</hi> or preceptive part commanding Innocency? Who would have thought but this was his drift? If it be not, all his angry Opposition to me, is upon a mistake so foul, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence forbids me to name with its proper Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: If it be, how can the same Man hold, That we are justified as in Christ, conform <hi>to the Precept</hi> of <hi>perfect Innocency?</hi> And yet that <hi>The Scripture mentioneth no Justification at all,</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>besides that one, which is Absolution from the Maledictory Sentence of the Law.</hi> But still mistakes have discord with themselves.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. It is the judgment indeed of Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, Wotton, Piscator, Paraeus, Ʋrsine, Wende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and abundance other excellent Divines, that as sins of omission are truly sin, and <hi>poena damni,</hi> or privations truly punishment; so for a sinner for his sin to be denied God's Love and Favour, Grace and Glory, is to be punished; and to be pardoned, is to have this privative punishment remitted as well as the rest; and so that Justification containeth our Right to Glory, as it is the bare forgiveness of the penalty of sin; because Death and Life, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Light are such Contraries, as that one is but the privation of the other: But this Learned Doctor seemeth to be of the commoner Opinion, that the Remission of Sin is but one part of our Justification, and that by Imputation of perfect
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61305:87"/> Holiness and Obedience we must have another part, which is our <hi>Right to the Reward;</hi> (and I think a little Explication would end that difference). But doth he here then agree with himself? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the common way of those with whom he joyneth? Do they not hold that Justification is more than an <hi>Absolution from the Maledictory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law?</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. But indeed his very Description by <hi>Absolution</hi> is utterly ambiguous: 1. Absolution is either by <hi>Actual Pardon,</hi> by the Law or Covenant of Grace; which giveth us our <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Impunity:</hi> 2. Or by <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Judg, who publickly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth</hi> our Case, and declareth our Right determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively: Or by execution of that Sentence in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al delivering us from penalty; And who knoweth which of these he meaneth? This is but confusion, to describe by an unexplained equivocal word.</p>
                        <p>And who knoweth what Law he meaneth, whose <hi>Maledictory Sentence</hi> Justification absolveth us from? Doth he think that the Law of Innocency, and of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Law of Grace are all one, which Scripture so frequently distinguisheth? Or that each of them hath not its <hi>Malediction?</hi> If he deny this, I refer him to my full proof of it, to Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> and elsewhere. If not, we should know whether he mean all, or which.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And what he meaneth by the Sentence of the Law is uncertain: Whether it be the Laws <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> as obliging us to punishment, which is not a <hi>Sentence</hi> in the usual proper sense, but only a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sentence,</hi> that is, the <hi>Norma Judicis;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mean the <hi>Sentence of God as Judg,</hi> according to the <hi>Law:</hi> which is not the Sentence of the Law
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61305:88"/> properly, but of the Judg: It's more intelligible speaking, and distinct, that must edifie us, and end those Controversies which ambiguities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion bred and feed.</p>

But which-ever he meaneth, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not true that the Scripture mentioneth no other Justification in <hi>foro Dei.</hi> For many of the fore-cited Texts tell us, that it oft mentioneth a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which is no Absolution from the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Sentence, (neither of the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of Grace) but a Justification of a Man's innocency in <hi>tantum,</hi> or <hi>quoad Causam hanc particularem, Viz.</hi>

                        <p>I would give here to the Reader, a help for some excuse of the Author, <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>[praeter unam illam quae est Absolutio]</hi> he might mean, which is <hi>partly Absolution,</hi> and <hi>partly Acceptation,</hi> as of a fulfiller of the Precept of Perfection by Christ, and partly Right to the Reward, all three making up the whole; but that I must not teach him how to speak his own mind, or think that he knew not how to utter it; And specially, because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances here prove that even so it is very far from Truth, had he so spoken.</p>

If <hi>Justice,</hi> (Righteousness) and <hi>Just,</hi> be otherwise used, that's all one in the sense, and almost in the word; seeing it is confessed, that <hi>to Justifie,</hi> is, 1. To <hi>make Just;</hi> 2. Or to <hi>esteem Just;</hi> 3. Or <hi>sentence Just;</hi> 4. Or to prove Just, and defend as Just; 5. Or to <hi>use</hi> as Just by execution.

The first Text cited by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right contradicts him: Not only <hi>Augustine,</hi> but divers Protestant Expositors suppose, that by the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> is meant, either the <hi>quickning Spirit it self</hi> given to us that are in Christ, or the Gospel, as it <hi>giveth that Spirit into us;</hi> And that by <hi>delivering</hi> us from the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> is meant either from that <hi>sin which is</hi> as a <hi>Law within us,</hi> or <hi>Moses Law,</hi> as it forbiddeth and commandeth all its peculiarities, and so maketh <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> them sin; and as it declareth sin, yea, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally irritateth it: Yea, that by the Law of Death is meant, not only that Law we are cursed by, and so guilty, but chiefly that Law, as it is said <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. to <hi>kill Paul,</hi> and to occasion the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of sin, and the Life of it: And that by <hi>[the fulfilling of the Law in us, that walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit],</hi> is meant [that by the Spirit and Grace of Christ, Christians do fulfil the Law, as it requireth sincere Holiness, Sobriety and Righteousness, which God accepteth for Christ's sake; which the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> without Christ's Spirit, enabled no Man to fulfil]. Not to weary the Reader with citing Expositors, I now only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to peruse, <hi>Ludov. de Dieu</hi> on the Text.</p>
                        <p>And it is certain, that the Law that <hi>Paul</hi> there speaketh of, was <hi>Moses</hi> Law: And that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all along, that the observation of it was not necessary to the Gentiles, to their <hi>performance,</hi> or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61305:90"/> Justification and Salvation, <hi>(necessitate praecepti vel medii);</hi> (for it would not justifie the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves). And sure, 1. all his meaning is not, [The Law will not absolve Men from the sense of the Law]. But also <hi>its Works</hi> will give no one the just title of a Righteous Man, accepted of God, and saved by him, as judging between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked: (as Christ saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>The Righteous shall go into Everlasting Life,</hi> &amp;c.) 2. And if it were only the <hi>Maledictory Sentence</hi> of <hi>Moses Law,</hi> as such, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from, as our only Justification, then none but Jews and Proselites who were under that Law, could have the Justification by Faith which he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for it curseth none else: For what-ever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law: The rest of the World were only under the Law of lapsed Nature, (the relicts of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency) and the Curse for <hi>Adam</hi>'s first Violation; and the Law of Grace made to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and after perfected fullier by Christ in its second Edition.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But doth he know but <hi>one sort of Law</hi> of God? Hath every Man incurred the Curse by <hi>Moses</hi> Law that did by <hi>Adams?</hi> Or every Man fallen under the peremptory irreversible condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Law of Grace passeth on them that never believe and repent? Doth this Law, <hi>[He that believeth not shall be damned]</hi> damn Believers? One Law condemneth all that are not Innocent. Another supposeth them under that defect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth peremptorily (not every Sinner) but the Wicked and Unbelievers.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Again here he saith, <hi>[Justification is Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Penalty].</hi> But is a Man absolved (properly) from that which he was never guilty of? Indeed if he take <hi>Absolution</hi> so loosly as to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, the justifying a Man against a false Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pronouncing him <hi>Not-Guilty;</hi> So all the Angels in Heaven may possibly be capable of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: Justification is ordinarily so used, but Absolution seldom by Divines. And his words shew that this is not his sense, if I understand them. But if we are reputed perfect fulfillers of the Law of Innocency by Christ, and yet Justification is our Absolution from the Curse, then no Man is justified that is Righteous by that Imputation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And how unable is my weak Understanding, to make his words at peace with themselves? The same Man in the next lines saith, <hi>[Lex nisi praesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta neminem justificat:</hi> and all <hi>Justification before God must be legal or none];</hi> so that no Man is justified but as reputed Innocent, or a performer of the Law:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61305:91"/> And yet <hi>Justification</hi> is our Absolution from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and Malediction of the Law; As if he said, No Man is justified but by the pardon of that sin which he is reputed never to have had, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from that Curse and Punishment which he is reputed never to have deserved or been under. Are these things reconcileable? But if really he take <hi>Absolution</hi> for justifying or acquitting from a false Accusation, and so to be absolved from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of the Law, is to be reputed one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deserved it, or was under it, then it's as much as to say, that there is no pardon of sin, or that no Man that is pardoned, or reputed to need a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is justified.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All this and such Speeches would perswade the Reader that this Learned Disputer thinketh that I took and use the word [Legal] generally as of that which is related to any Law <hi>in genere,</hi> and so take <hi>Evangelical</hi> contrarily for that which is related to no Law: whereas I over and over tell him, that (speaking in the usual Language that I may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood) I take [Legal] <hi>specially</hi> (and not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) for that Righteousness which is related to the <hi>Law of Works</hi> or <hi>Innocency,</hi> (not as if we had indeed such a Righteousness as that Law will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us for; But a <hi>pro-Legal-Righteousness,</hi> one <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of it, in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> our perfect Saviour, which shall effectually save us from that Laws condemnation): And that by <hi>[Evaugelical Righteousness],</hi> I mean, that which is related to the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> as the Rule of <hi>Judgment,</hi> upon the just pleading whereof that Law will not condemn but justifie us. If he knew this to be my meaning, in my weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he should not have written either as if he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61305:91"/> did not, or as if he would perswade his Rsaders to the contrary: For Truth is most congruously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Truth: But if he <hi>knew it not,</hi> I despair of becoming intelligible to him, by any thing that I can write, and I shall expect that this Reply be wholly lost to him and worse.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. His <hi>[Lex nisi praestita neminem justificat]</hi> is true; and therefore no Man is justified by the Law, But his next words <hi>[&amp; praestitam omnes in Christo agnoscunt]</hi> seemeth to mean that <hi>[It was performed by us in Christ];</hi> Or that <hi>[It justifieth us, because performed perfectly by Christ as such]:</hi> Which both are the things that we most confidently deny. It was not Physically, or Morally, or Politically, or Legally, or Reputatively, (take which word you will) <hi>fulfilled by us in Christ:</hi> it doth not justifie us, because it was fulfilled by Christ, <hi>(as such,</hi> or immediately, and <hi>eo nomine).</hi> It justified <hi>Christ,</hi> because he fulfilled it; and so their Law doth all the perfect Angels. But we did not personally fulfil it in Christ; it never allowed <hi>vicarium obedientiae</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it by our <hi>selves</hi> or another: Therefore anothers <hi>Obedience,</hi> merely as such, (even a Mediators) is not our Obedience or Justification: But that Obedience justifieth us, as given us only in or to the effecting of our Personal Righteousness, which consisteth in our right to Impunity, and to God's Favour and Life, freely given for Christ's Merits sake, and in our performance of the Conditions of the Law of Grace, or that free Gift, which is therefore not a co-ordinate but a sub-ordinate Righteousness (and Justification) to qualifie us for the former. This is so plain and necessary, that if (in sense) it be not understood by all that are admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental

For the Law hath but one fixed sense, and may be it self changed, but changeth not it self, nor accepteth a <hi>tantundem:</hi> And Christ's suffering for us, was a <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law, which peculiarly <hi>bound him</hi> to suffer, and not a Satisfaction <hi>loco so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionis ejusdem:</hi> And it was no <hi>fulfilling</hi> the <hi>Penal part</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> as it bound <hi>us</hi> to suffer: For so it bound none but us; so that the <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>binding</hi> us to <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Suffering,</hi> was neither <hi>fulfilled,</hi> nor strictly <hi>satisfied</hi> by Christ; but the <hi>Law-giver</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and the remote ends of the Law attained, by Christ's perfect fulfilling all that Law which bound himself as Mediator.</p>
                        <p>Now whether he mean the Law as binding us to <hi>Duty,</hi> or to <hi>Punishment,</hi> or both, and what by <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> I am not sure: But as far as I can make sense of it, it seeneth to mean, that <hi>Poena</hi> is <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio loco obedientiae,</hi> and that Punishment being our Due, this was <hi>satisfactio Legi praestandâ,</hi> (for he saith not <hi>Praestita).</hi> But then he must judge that we are justified only from the <hi>penal Obligation</hi> of the Law, and not from the <hi>preceptive Obligation</hi> to perfect Obedience. And this will not stand with the scope of other Passages, where he endureth not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61305:95"/> my Opinion, that we are not <hi>justified</hi> by the <hi>fac hoc,</hi> the Precept as fulfilled, or from the <hi>Reatus Culpae in se,</hi> but by Christ's whole Righteousness from the <hi>Reatus ut ad paenam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if this be his sense, he meaneth then that it is only the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> that <hi>Justification</hi> is properly denominated from. And why so? 1. As <hi>Justitia</hi> and <hi>Justificatio passive sumpta, vel ut effectus,</hi> is <hi>Relatio,</hi> it hath necessarily no <hi>Terminus à quo;</hi> And certainly is <hi>in specie,</hi> to be rather denominated from its own proper <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> And as <hi>Justification</hi> is taken for the Justifiers <hi>Action;</hi> why is it not as well to be denominated from the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> as <hi>à quo? Justificatio efficiens sic dicitur, quia Justum facit: Justificatio apologetica, quia Justum vindicat vel probat. Justificatio per sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, quia Justum aliquem esse Judicat: Justificatio executiva, quia ut Justum eum tractat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if we must needs denominate from the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus à quo,</hi> how strange is it that he should know but of <hi>one</hi> sense of <hi>Justification?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But yet perhaps he meaneth, <hi>[In satisfactione Legi praestitâ,</hi> though he say <hi>praestandâ,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominateth from the <hi>Terminus à quo:</hi> But if so, 1. Then it cannot be true: For <hi>satisfacere &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificare</hi> are not the same thing, nor is <hi>Justifying giving Satisfaction;</hi> nor were we justified when Christ had satisfied, but long after: Nor are we justified <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because Christ satisfied, (that is, immediately) but because he gave us that <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; vitam &amp; spiritum sanctum,</hi> which is the <hi>Fruit</hi> of his Satisfaction. 2. And as is said, if it be only <hi>in satisfactione,</hi> then it is not in that <hi>Obedience which fulfileth</hi> the preceptive part as it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61305:95"/> bound us: for to satisfie for not fulfilling, is not to fulfil it. 3. And then no Man is justified, for no Man hath satisfied either the Preceptive or Penal Obligation of the Law, by himself or another: But Christ hath satisfied the Law-giver by Merit and Sacrifice for sin.</p>
                        <p>His <hi>Liberavit nos à Lege Mortis,</hi> I before shewed impertinent to his use, Is <hi>Liberare &amp; Justificare.</hi> or <hi>Satisfacere</hi> all one? And is <hi>à Lege Mortis,</hi> either from all the Obligation to Obedience, or from the sole malcdiction? There be other Acts of <hi>Liberation</hi> besides <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> For it is <hi>[The Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life]</hi> that doth it: And we are freed both from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>indwelling-sin,</hi> (called a Law) and from the Mosaical Yoak, and from the Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Conditions of the Law of Innocency, though not from its bare Obligation to future Duty.</p>

When I read that he will have but one sense or sort of Justification, will yet have the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to be <hi>ex termino,</hi> and so justifieth my distinction of it, according to the various <hi>Termini;</hi> And here how he maketh the Righteousness of Christ to be but the <hi>MEDIƲM</hi> of our Justification, (though he should have told us which sort of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> he meaneth) he seemeth to me a very favourable consenting Adversary: And I doubt those Divines who maintain that Christ's Rignteousness is the <hi>Causa Formalis</hi> of our Justification, (who are no small ones, nor a few, though other in answer to the Papists disclaim it) yea, and those that make it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61305:96"/> but <hi>Causa Materialis,</hi> (which may have a sound sense) will think this Learned Man betrayeth their Cause by prevarication, and seemeth to set fiercly against me, that he may yeeld up the Cause with less suspicion. But the truth is, we all know but in part, and therefore err in part, and Error is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with it self. And as we have conflicting Flesh and Spirit in the <hi>Will,</hi> so have we conflicting <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; And it is very perceptible throughout this Author's Book, that in one line the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> saith one thing, and in the next oft the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> saith the contrary, and seeth not the inconsistency: And so though the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>fleshy</hi> part rise up in wrathful striving Zeal against the Concord and Peace of Christians, on pretence that other Mens Errors wrong the Truth, yet I doubt not but Love and Unity have some interest in his lucid and Spiritual part. We do not only grant him that Christ's Righteousness is a <hi>Medium</hi> of our Justification, (for so also is <hi>Faith</hi> a <hi>Condition,</hi> and <hi>Dispositio Receptiva</hi> being a <hi>Medium);</hi> nor only some <hi>Cause,</hi> (for so also is the <hi>Covenant-Donation);</hi> but that it is an <hi>efficient meritorious Cause,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if Righteousness had been that of our own, <hi>Innocency</hi> would have been founded in <hi>Merit,</hi> we may call Christ's Righteousness the <hi>material Cause</hi> of our Justification, remotely, as it is <hi>Materia Meriti,</hi> the Matter of the <hi>Merit</hi> which procureth it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But for all this it followeth not that all Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is only <hi>Legal,</hi> as <hi>Legal</hi> noteth its respect to the Law of Innocency: For 1. we are justified from or against che Accusation of being non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of the Condition of the Law of Grace;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61305:96"/> 2. And of being therefore unpardoned, and lyable to its sorer Penalty. 3. Our particular subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Personal Righteousness consisting in the said performance of those Evangelical Conditions of Life, is so denominated from its conformity to the Law of Grace, (as it instituteth its own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) as the measure of it, (as <hi>Rectitudo ad Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam).</hi> 4. Our <hi>Jus ad impunitatem &amp; vitam,</hi> resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the <hi>Donative</hi> Act of the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as the <hi>Titulus qui est Fundamentum Juris,</hi> or supposition of our Faith as the Condition. 5. This Law of Grace is the <hi>Norma Judicis,</hi> by which we shall be judged at the Last Day. 6. The same Judg doth now <hi>per sententiam conceptam</hi> judg of us, as he will then judg <hi>per sententiam prola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi> 7. Therefore the Sentence being <hi>virtually</hi> in the Law, this same Law of Grace, which in <hi>primo instanti</hi> doth make <hi>us Righteous,</hi> (by <hi>Condonation</hi> and <hi>Donation</hi> of Right) doth <hi>in secundo instanti, virtually</hi> justifie us as containing that regulating use, by which we are to be sententially justified. And now judg Reader, whether no Justification be Evangelical, or by the Law of Grace, and so to be denominated: (for it is <hi>lis de nomine</hi> that is by him managed). 8. Besides that the whole frame of Causes in the Work of Redemption, (the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, his Righteousness, Merits, Sacrifice, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Act, Intercession, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> are sure rather to be called Matters of the Gospel, than of the Law.</p>
                        <p>And yet we grant him easily; 1. That Christ perfectly fulfilled the Law of Innocency, and was justified thereby, and that we are justified by that Righteousness of his, as the meritorious Cause.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61305:97"/> 2. That we being guilty of Sin and Death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of that Law, and that Guilt being remitted by Christ, as aforesaid, we are therefore justified from that Law, (that is, from its Obligation of us to Innocency as the necessary terms of Life, and from its Obligation of us to Death, for want of Innocency): But we are not justified by that Law, either as fulfilled or as satisfied by <hi>us our selves,</hi> either personally or by an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, substitute or proper Representative, that was <hi>Vicarius Obedientiae aut poenae.</hi> 3. And we grant that the Jews were delivered from the positive Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Law, which is it that <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, <hi>The Law of Works.</hi> And if he please, in all these respects to call <hi>Justification Legal,</hi> we intend not to quarrel with the name, (though what I called <hi>Legal</hi> in those <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> I chose ever after to call rather, <hi>Justitia pro-legalis).</hi> But we cannot believe him, 1.

                        <p n="1">1. The common distinction in Politicks, <hi>inter judicium Privatum &amp; Publicum,</hi> is fetcht from the <hi>Judg,</hi> who is either <hi>Persona privata vel publica:</hi> a <hi>private</hi> Man, or an <hi>authorized Judg</hi> judging as such: And so the Judgment of Conscience, Friends, Enemies, Neighbours, mere Arbitrators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Judicium privatum;</hi> and that of a <hi>Judg in foro,</hi> is <hi>Judicium publicum,</hi> (yea, or in secret, before the concerned Parties only in his Closet, so it be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive): If this Learned Doctor so understand it, then, 1. <hi>Constitutive Justification</hi> (which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly first) is publick Justification, being done by God the Father, and by our Redeemer, who sure are not herein <hi>private</hi> authorized <hi>Persons.</hi> 2. And the first <hi>sentential Justification,</hi> as merely <hi>Virtual,</hi> and not yet <hi>Actual,</hi> viz. as it's virtually in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Law of Grace as <hi>norma Judicis</hi> is <hi>publick in suo genere,</hi> being the <hi>virtus</hi> of a Publick Law of God, or of his Donative Promise. 3. And the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61305:98"/> first <hi>Actual Justification, per Deum Judicem per sententiam conceptam</hi> (which is God's secret judging the Thing and Person to be as they are) is (secret indeed <hi>in se,</hi> yet revealed by God's publick Word but) publick as to the Judg. 4. And the first <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia prolata</hi> (the fourth in order) is someway publick as opposite to secresie, (for, 1. it is before the Angels of Heaven; 2. And in part by Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive demonstrations on Earth): But it is certainly by a <hi>publick Judg,</hi> that is, God. 5. And the first <hi>Apologetical Justification</hi> by Christ our <hi>Interceding Advocate,</hi> is publick both <hi>quoad personam,</hi> and as <hi>openly</hi> done in Heaven: And if this worthy Person deny any Justification <hi>per sententiam Judicis,</hi> upon our first Believing, or before the final Judgment, he would wofully fall out with the far greatest number of Protestants, and especially his closest Friends, who use to make <hi>a Sentence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as Judg to be the <hi>Genus</hi> to Justification.</p>
                        <p>But if by <hi>[Private</hi> and <hi>Publick Justification];</hi> he means <hi>[secret</hi> and <hi>open].</hi> 1.

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> To the first, I say, 1. It is certain by <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 10. that the Angels know of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Sinner, and therefore of his Justification and publickly Rejoyce therein. Therefore it is noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them. 2. But I refer the Reader for this, to what I have said to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in my <hi>Disputation of Justification,</hi> where I do give my thoughts, That this is not the Justification by Faith meant by <hi>Paul,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> asserteth it to be.</p>
                        <p>To the Second, I say, Too many have abused Theology, by the misconceiving of the distinction of <hi>Immanent</hi> and <hi>Transient Acts</hi> of God, taking all for <hi>Immanent</hi> which effect nothing <hi>ad extra.</hi> But none are properly <hi>Immanent quoad Objectum,</hi> but such as God himself is the <hi>Object</hi> of, (as <hi>se in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere, se amare):</hi> An Act may be called indeed immanent in any of these three respects; 1. <hi>Ex parte Agentis;</hi> 2. <hi>Ex parte Objecti;</hi> 3. <hi>Ex parte effectus.</hi> 1. <hi>Ex parte agentis,</hi> all God's Acts are <hi>Immanent,</hi> for they are his Essence. 2. <hi>Ex parte Objecti vel Termini,</hi> God's Judging a Man Just or Unjust, Good or Bad, is transient; because it is denominated from the state of the <hi>Terminus</hi> or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And so it may be <hi>various</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively, notwithstanding God's <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Immutability.</hi> And so the <hi>Sententia Concepta</hi> is not <hi>ab Aeterno.</hi> 3. As to the <hi>Effect,</hi> all confess God's Acts to be Transient and Temporary. But there are some that <hi>effect</hi> not (as to judg a thing to be what it is).</p>

                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61305:99"/> 3. Either this Militant Disputer would have his Reader believe that I say, That a <hi>Man is justified by Works,</hi> in that which he called <hi>[making just,</hi> and the <hi>first Justification],</hi> or not: If he would, such <hi>untruth</hi> and <hi>unrighteousness</hi> (contrary to the full drift of many of my Books, and even that which he selected to oppose) is not a congruous way of disputing for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness:</hi> nor indeed is it tolerably ingenuous or modest. If not, then why doth he all along carry his professed agreement with me, in a militant strain, perswading his Reader, that I savour of Socinianism or Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or some dangerous Error, by saying the very same that he saith. O what thanks doth God's Church owe such contentious Disputers for suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Orthodoxness, that like <hi>noctambuli,</hi> will rise in their sleep, and cry, Fire, Fire, or beat an Allarm on their Drums, and cry out, <hi>The Enemy, The Enemy,</hi> and will not let their Neighbours rest!</p>
                        <p>I have wearied my Readers with so oft repeating in my Writings (upon such repeated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others) these following, Assertions about Works.</p>

                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p n="2">2. And also our consent to Christ's Teaching, Government, Intercession, as to Imputation.</p>

                        <p>Reader, Forgive me this troublesom oft repeating the state of the Controversie; I meddle with no other. If this be Justification by Works, I am for it. If this Doctor be against it, he is against much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61305:101"/> of the Gospel. If he be not, he had better have kept his Bed, than to have call'd us to Arms in his Dream, when we have sadly warred so many Ages already about mere words. For my part, I think that such a short explication of our sense, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ambiguities, is fitter to end these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, than the long disputations of Confounders.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But when be saith, <hi>[Works make not a Man just, and yet we are at last justified according to them],</hi> it is a contradiction, or unsound. For if he mean <hi>Works</hi> in the sence excluded by <hi>Paul,</hi> we are not justified <hi>according to them, viz.</hi> such as make, or are thought to make the <hi>Reward to be not of Grace,</hi> but <hi>of Debt:</hi> But if he take <hi>Works</hi> in the sense intended by <hi>James, sincere Obedience</hi> is a <hi>secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary constitutive part</hi> of that <hi>inherent or adherent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Righteousness, required by the Law of Grace, in subordination to Christ's Meritorious Righteousness;</hi> And what Christian can deny this? So far it <hi>maketh</hi> us <hi>Righteous,</hi> (as <hi>Faith</hi> doth <hi>initially).</hi> And what is it to be <hi>justified according to our Works,</hi> but to be judged, so far as they are sincerely done, to be such as have performed the secondary part of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of free-given Life?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. His <hi>[According]</hi> but not <hi>[ex operibus]</hi> at the Last Judgment, is but a Logomachie <hi>[Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding]</hi> signifieth as much as I assert: But <hi>[ex]</hi> is no un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Is this the mode of our present Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Disputers, To pass by the stating of the Controversie, yea, to silence the state of it, as laid down by the Author, whom he opposeth in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, (and more fully elsewhere often)? Reader, the Author of the <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> pag. 45. and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, distinguishing as Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> doth, of the several senses of Imputation, and how Christ's Righteousness is made ours, 1. Beginneth with their Opinion, who hold, <hi>[That Christ did so obey in our stead, as that in God▪s esteem, and in point of Law we were in Christ dying and suffering, and so in him we did both perfectly fulfil the Commands of the Law by Obedience, and the Threatnings of it by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penalty, and thus (say they) is Christ's Righteousness imputed to us,</hi> viz. <hi>His Passive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness for the pardon of our sins, and deliverance from the Penalty; His Active Righteousness for the making of us Righteous, and giving us title to the Kingdom; And some say the Habitual Righteousness of his Humane Nature, instead of our own Habitual Righteousness; Yea, some add the Righteousness of the Divine Nature].</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second Opinion which he reciteth is this, <hi>[That God the Father accepteth the sufferings and merits of his Son, as a valuable consideration, on which he will wholly forgive and acquit the Offenders, and receive them into his favour, and give them the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a more excellent happiness, so they will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Son on the terms expressed in the Gospel.</hi>

                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:61305:107"/>
                        <p> And as distinct from theirs, who would thus have the <hi>Passive Righteousness only imputed,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himself to hold with <hi>Bradshaw, Grotius,</hi> &amp;c. that the Active also is so imputed, being <hi>Justitia Meriti,</hi> as well as <hi>Personae,</hi> and endeavoureth to prove it: But not imputed in the first rigid sense, as if God esteemed us to <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>done,</hi> and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> our <hi>selves in</hi> and <hi>by Christ,</hi> and merited <hi>by him.</hi> Thus he states the Controversie; And doth this Doctor fight for Truth and Peace, by 1. passing by all this; 2. Saying, I am against Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; 3. And against the Reformed? Were not all the Divines before named Reformed? Was not <hi>Camero, Capellus, Placeus, Amyrald, Dallaeus, Blondel,</hi> &amp;c. Reformed? Were not <hi>Wotton, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw, Gataker,</hi> &amp;c. Reformed? Were not of late Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Truman,</hi> to pass many yet alive, Reformed? Must that Name be shamed, by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating it to such as this Doctor only?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And now let the Reader judg, with what face he denieth the Consequence, (that it <hi>supposeth us to have been in Christ legally,</hi> &amp;c.) When as I put it into the Opinion opposed, and opposed no other. But I erred in saying, that <hi>[most of our ordinary Divines]</hi> hold it; But he more in fathering it in common on the Reformed.</p>

Reader, my words were these, (just like <hi>Bradshaws) [It teacheth Imputation of Christ's Righteousness in so strict a sense, as will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stand with Reason, nor the Doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much less with the PHRASE of Scripture, which mentioneth no Imputation of Christ or his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness].</hi> 1. Is this a denying of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed? Or only of that intollerable <hi>sense</hi> of it? 2. Do I say here that Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth not Imputed Righteousness, or only that strict sense of it? 3.

                        <p n="2">2. And as to the Phrase, Doth this Doctor, or can any living Man find that <hi>Phrase</hi> in Scripture, <hi>[Christ's Righteousness is imputed to us]?</hi> And when he knoweth that it is not there, are not his Exclamations, and his Bug-bears <hi>[Cracovian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine]</hi> his dishonour, that hath no better Weapons to use against the Churches Peace? To tell us that the <hi>sense</hi> or Doctrine is in Scripture, when the question is of the <hi>Phrase,</hi> or that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh in his rigid sense, and not in ours, is but to lose time, and abuse the Reader, the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impertinent, and the second the begging of the Question.</p>

The Greek word answering to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, is ten times in</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>And what is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but Righteousness? we have then some imputed Righteousness. The Question is, only what or whose it is, Christ's or our own? Not ours, therefore Christs: If ours, either its the Righteousness of Works, or of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But what's all this to the <hi>Phrase?</hi> Could you have found that Phrase <hi>[Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is imputed],</hi> why did you not recite the words, but <hi>Reason</hi> as for the sense?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Is that your way of Disputation, to prove that the Text speaketh of the <hi>Imputation of Christ's Righteousness,</hi> when the Question was only, <hi>In what sense?</hi> What kind of Readers do you expect, that shall take this for rational, candid, and a Plea for Truth?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But to a Man that cometh unprejudiced, it is most plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by <hi>[imputing it for Righteousness]</hi> that the Person was or is, <hi>accounted, reckoned,</hi> or <hi>judged Righteous,</hi> where <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is mentioned as the <hi>formal Relation</hi> of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: so that what-ever be the matter of it (of which next) the <hi>formal Relation</hi> sure is our <hi>own,</hi> and so here said: And if it be from the matter of Christ's Righteousness, yet that must be <hi>our own,</hi> by your Opinion. And it must be <hi>our own, in</hi> and <hi>to</hi> the proper <hi>Effects,</hi> in mine. But sure it is not the same <hi>numerical</hi> formal Relation of <hi>[Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness]</hi> that is in Christ's <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> ours: And it's that formal Relation, as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not in Christ, that is called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Reputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

                        <p n="2">2. You and I shall shortly find that it will be the Question on which we shall be Justified or Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; not only whether we received Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but whether by Faith we received Christ in all the Essentials of his Office, and to all the essential saving Uses: Yea, whether according to the sense of the Baptismal Covenant, we first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61305:109"/> received, and gave up our selves to God the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and after performed sincerely that Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But let me defend the Word of God: Faith is imputed for Righteousness, even <hi>this Faith now described;</hi> 1. <hi>Remotely, ex materiae aptitudine,</hi> for its fitness to its formal Office; And that fitness is, 1. Because it is an <hi>Act of Obedience to God,</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good,</hi> (for a <hi>bad</hi> or <hi>indifferent Act</hi> doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie). 2. More specially as it is the <hi>receiving, trusting,</hi> and <hi>giving</hi> up <hi>our selves</hi> to God the <hi>Father,</hi> Son, and Holy Ghost, to the proper ends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or a suitable Reception of the freely offered Gift; and so connoteth Christ the Object (for the Object is essential to the Act <hi>in specie).</hi> 2. But proximately <hi>Faith</hi> is so <hi>reputed,</hi> or imputed, as it is the <hi>performance</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Covenant or Donation.</p>
                        <p>And to be <hi>imputed</hi> for <hi>Righteousness,</hi> includeth, That <hi>[It is the part required of us by the Law of Grace, to make us partakers of the Benefits of Christ's Righteousness, which meriteth Salvation for us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a legal and perfect Righteousness of our own,</hi> (which we have not). Or, <hi>[Whereas we fell short of a Righteousness of Innocency, Christ by such a Righteousness hath merited our Pardon and Salvation, and giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Reader, I was going on to Answer the rest, but my time is short, Death is at the door: Thou seest what kind of Work I have of it, even to detect a Learned Man's Oversights, and temerarious Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.

                           <hi>Lest any who know not how to stop in mediocrity,</hi> should be tempted by Socinians or Papists, to think that we countenance any of their Errors, or that our Differences in the point of Justification by Faith or Works, are greater than indeed they are; and lest any weak Opinionative Persons, should clamour unpeaceably against their Brethren, and think to raise a name to themselves for their differing Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I shall here give the Reader such evidences of our real Concord, as shall silence that Calumny.</p>
                        <p>Though some few Lutherans did, upon peevish suspiciousness against <hi>George Major</hi> long ago, assert, That [Good Works are not necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]: And though some few good Men, whose Zeal without Judgment doth better serve their own turn than the Churches, are jealous, lest all the good that is ascribed to Man, be a dishonour to God; and therefore speak as if God were honoured most by saying the worst words of our selves; and many have uncomely and irregular Notions about these Matters: And though some that are addicted to sidings, do take it to be their Godly Zeal to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and reproach the more understanding sort, when they most grosly err themselves: And though too many of the People are carried about through injudiciousness and temptations to false Doctrines and evil Lives; yet is the Argument of Protestants thus manifested.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They all affirm that Christ's Sacrifice, with his Holiness and perfect Obedience, are the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cause of the forgiving Covenants, and of our Pardon and Justification thereby, and of our Right to Life Eternal, which it giveth us. And that this Price was not paid or given in it self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61305:111"/> to us, but to God for us; and so, that our foresaid Benefits are its Effects.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. They all agree, that we are justified by none, but a practical or working Faith.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And that this Faith is the Condition of the Promise, or Gift of Justification and Adoption.</p>

                        <p n="8">8. And they all agree, that in the first instant of a Man's Conversion or Believing, he is entred into a state of Justification, before he hath done any outward Works: and that so it is true, that good Works follow the Justified, and go not before his initial Justification: as also in the sense that <hi>Austin</hi> spake it, who took Justification, for that which we call Sanctification or Conversion.</p>
                        <p n="9">9.

                        <p n="12">12. They all agree, that no Man can possibly merit of God in point of Commutative Justice, nor yet in point of Distributive or Governing Justice, according to the Law of Nature or Innocency, as <hi>Adam</hi> might have done, nor by the Works of the Mosaical Law.</p>

                        <p n="15">15. They all judg reverently and charitably of the Ancients, that used the word [Merit of Good Works], because they meant but a moral aptitude for the promised Reward, according to the Law of Grace through Christ.</p>

They all agree, that all faithful Ministers must bend the labour of their Ministry in publick and private, for promoting of Holiness and good Works, and that they must difference by Discipline between the Obedient and the Disobedient.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61305:114"/> Phrase of Man's inventing: But if indeed you mean any more than I by your <hi>sensus forensis, viz.</hi> that such a <hi>suffering</hi> and <hi>meriting</hi> for us may, in the lax improper way of some Lawyers speaking, be called, <hi>[Our own Doing, Meriting, Suffering,</hi> &amp;c.] I have proved, that the Doctrine denied by me, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the Gospel of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Reader, I remember what <hi>Grotius</hi> (then Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, thirty years before his Death) in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Letter of Church-Orders, Predestination, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, and Magistrates, animadverting on <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> saith, <hi>How great an injury those Divines, who turn the Christian Doctrine into unintelligible Notions and Controversies, do to Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; because it is the duty of Magistrates to discern and preserve necessary sound Doctrine, which these Men would make them unable to discern.</hi> The same I must say of their injury to all Christians, because all should hold fast that which is proved True and Good, which this sort of Men would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to discern. We justly blame the Papists for locking up the Scripture, and performing their Worship in an unknown Tongue. And alas, what abundance of well-meaning Divines do the same thing by undigested Terms and Notions, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Distinctions, not adapted to the Matter, but customarily used from some Persons reverenced by them that led the way? It is so in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, both of Theology and other Sciences; and the great and useful Rule, <hi>Verba Rebus aptanda sunt,</hi> is laid aside: or rather, Men that understand not Matter, are like enough to be little skilful in the expressing of it: And as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> saith, A cloudy unintelligible stile, usually signifieth a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61305:115"/> unintelligent Head, (to that sense): And as Mr. <hi>J.

                        <p>To deliver thee from those Learned Obscurities, read but the Scripture impartially, without their Spectacles and ill-devised Notions, and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification that is necessary, will be plain to thee: And I will venture again to fly so far from flattering those, called Learned Men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, as to profess that I am perswaded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of honest unlearned Christians, (even Plowmen and Women) do better understand the Doctrine of Justification, than many great Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will suffer themselves or others to understand it, by reason of their forestalling ill-made Notions: these unlearned Persons commonly conceive, 1. That Christ in his own Person, as a Mediator, did by his perfect Righteousness and Sufferings, merit for us the free pardon of all our sins, and the Gift of his Spirit and Life Eternal, and hath promised Pardon to all that are Penitent Believers, and Heaven to all that so continue, and sincerely obey him to the end; and that all our after-failings, as well as our former sins, are freely pardoned by the Sacrifice, Merits, and Intercession of Christ, who also giveth
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61305:115"/> us his Grace for the performance of his imposed Conditions, and will judg us, as we have or have not performed them]. Believe but this plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and you have a righter understanding of Justification, than many would let you quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, who tell you, [That Faith is not imputed for Righteousness; that it justifieth you only as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Cause, and only as it is the reception of Christ's Righteousness, and that no other Act of Faith is justifying, and that God esteemeth us to have been perfectly Holy and Righteous, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all the Law, and died for our own sins, in or by Christ, and that he was politically the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of every Believing Sinner]; with more such like.</p>
                        <p>And as to this distinction which this Doctor will make a Test of the Orthodox, (that is, Men of of his Size and Judgment) you need but this plain explication of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>In Law-sense, a Man is truly and fitly said himself to have done that, which the Law or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract alloweth him to do either by himself or another;</hi> (as to do an Office, or pay a Debt by a Substitute or Vicar). For so I do it by my Instrument, and the Law is fulfilled and not broken by me, because I was at liberty which way to do it. In this sense I deny that we ever fulfilled all the Law by Christ; and that so to hold subverts all Religion as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Heresie.</p>

                        <p>I answer, No; nor will I abhor to say, That <hi>in sensu forensi, I am one political Person with Christ,</hi> and am <hi>perfectly holy</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> by and <hi>in him,</hi> and died and redeemed my self by him, when he shall prove them to be Scripture Phrases: But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader not to be so <hi>fond,</hi> (pardon the word) as by this bare question to be enticed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is any of the meaning of those Texts that use that Phrase which he mentioneth, that

                  <p>With your self I have no great business: I am not so vain as to think my self able to <hi>understand you,</hi> or to be <hi>understood</hi> by you: and I must not be so bold as to tell you why, much less will I be so injurious to the Reader, as by a <hi>particular examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your words,</hi> to extort a confession that their <hi>sense</hi> is <hi>less</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> than I could wish: For <hi>cui bono?</hi> What would this do but more offend you?

But for the sake of your <hi>Academical Youth,</hi> whom you thought meet to allarm by your Caution, I have answered so much of your Treatise as I thought necessary to help even Novices to answer the rest themselves. For their sakes (though I delight not to offend you) I must say, That if they would not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by such Books as yours, it is not an <hi>Answer</hi> to them that must be their preservative, but an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly studying of the Doctrines handled; Let them but learn truly the several senses of the word <hi>[Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification],</hi> and the <hi>several sorts,</hi> and <hi>what they are,</hi> and still constrain <hi>ambiguous words</hi> to confess <hi>their sense,</hi> and they will need no other Answer to such Writings.</p>
                  <p>And as to your Letter (passing by the spume and passion) I think these few Animadversions may suffice.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <p>§. I. Between twenty and thirty years ago, I did in a private Disputation prove our guilt of the sins of our nearer Parents; and because many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61305:121"/> doubted of it, I have oft since in other writings mentioned it: About three years ago, having two Books of Mr. <hi>William Allens</hi> in my hand to peruse, in order to a Publication, (a <hi>Perswasive to Ʋnity,</hi> and a <hi>Treatise of the Two Covenants);</hi> in a Preface to the latter, I said, <hi>[That most Writers, if not most Christians, do greatly darken the Sacred Doctrine, by overlooking the Interest of Children in the Actions of their nearer Parents, and think that they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of no guilt, and suffer for no original sin, but</hi> Adam<hi>'s only,</hi> &amp;c.] You fastened on this, and <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned seriously the Juniors, not rashly to believe one that brings forth such Paradoxes of his</hi> (or <hi>that) Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> which you added to your <hi>[O caecos ante Theologos quicunque unquam fuistis]:</hi> The charge was expressed by <hi>[aliud invenisse peccatum Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale, multo citerius quam quod ab</hi> Adamo <hi>traductum est].</hi> Hereupon I thought it enough to publish that old private Disputation, which many before had seen with various Censures: Now you send me in your Letter the strange tidings of the success: You that deterred your <hi>Juniors</hi> by so frighful a warning, seem now not only to <hi>agree with me,</hi> that we <hi>are guilty of our nearer Parents sin,</hi> and contract addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pravity from them as such, (which was my Assertion) but over-do all others, and Truth it self in your Agreement! Now you take it for an injury to be reported to think otherwise herein than I do: yea, and add, <hi>[Which neither I, nor any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy else I know of, denies as to the thing, though in the extent, and other circumstances, all are not agreed, and you may in that enjoy your Opinion for me].</hi> This is too kind: I am loth to tell you how many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61305:122"/> that I know, and have read, deny it, lest I tempt you to repent of your Agreement.</p>
                     <p>But doth the World yet need a fuller evidence, that some Men are <hi>de materià</hi> agreed with them, whom they raise the Country against by their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations and Suspicious?</p>
                     <p>But surely what passion or spatling soever it hath occasioned from you, I reckon that my labour is not lost: I may tell your <hi>Juniors,</hi> that I have sped ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary well, when I have procured the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished consent of such a Doctor. Either you were of this mind <hi>before</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> If not, it's well you are brought to confess the Truth, though not to confess a former Error. If yea, then it's well that so loud and wide a seeming disagreement is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be none, that your Juniors may take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not be frightned from Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by every melancholy Allarm.</p>
                     <p>Yea, you declare your conformity to the Litany, <hi>[Remember not our Offences, nor the Offences of our Fore fathers],</hi> and many words of indignation you use for my questioning it. All this I like very well as to the Cause; And I matter it not much how it looks at me: If you <hi>agree</hi> more <hi>angrily</hi> than others disagree, the <hi>Cause</hi> hath some advantage by the Agreement. Though me-thinks it argueth somewhat unusual, that seeming Dissenters should close by so vehement a Collision.</p>
                     <p>But yet you <hi>will not agree</hi> when you <hi>cannot chuse but agree,</hi> and you carry it still as if your Allarm had not been given without cause: Must we <hi>agree,</hi> and not <hi>agree?</hi> What yet is the Matter? Why it is <hi>[a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>w original sin].</hi> My ordinary expressions of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61305:122"/> it may be fully seen in the Disputation: The phrase you laid hold on in a Preface is cited before, <hi>[That we participate of no guilt, and suffer for no original sin but</hi> Adam<hi>'s only],</hi> I denied. And what's the dangerous <hi>Errour</hi> here? That our <hi>nearer Parents</hi> sin was <hi>Adams,</hi> I may presume that you hold not. That we are <hi>guilty</hi> of such, you <hi>deny not:</hi> That <hi>it is sin,</hi> I find you not denying: sure then all the difference must be in the word [ORIGINAL].</p>
                     <p>And if so, you that so hardly believe your loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noised disagreements to be but <hi>verbal,</hi> must pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently give me leave here to try it. Is it any more than the <hi>Name</hi> ORIGINAL that you are so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously offended at? Sure it is not: Else in this Letter purposely written about it, you would have told your <hi>Reader what it is.</hi> Suffer me then to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon your Allarm'd Juniors to come and see what a <hi>Spectrum</hi> it is that must affright them; and what a Poppet-Play or dreaming War it is, that the Church is to be engaged in, as if it were a matter of Life and Death? <hi>Audite juvenes!</hi> I took the word [ORIGINAL] in this business to have several sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications. First, That is called <hi>[ORIGINAL] Sin,</hi> which was the <hi>ORIGO</hi> of all other sins in the Humane World: And that was not <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>sin,</hi> but <hi>Eves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That which was the <hi>ORIGO</hi> of sin to all the World, save <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> communicated by the way of Generation: And that was <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> conjunct, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Their first sinful Acts; 2. Their Guilt; 3. And their habitual pravity (making it full, though in Nature following the Act). This Sin, Fact, Guilt, and Habit, as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61305:123"/> of the Persons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> are not Accidents of our Persons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Our personal participation;</hi> 1. <hi>In the guilt</hi> of the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> 2. And of a vicious <hi>privation</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> from them, as soon as we are Persons. Which is called <hi>Original</hi> sin, on three accounts conjunct; 1. Because it is a participation of their <hi>Original Act</hi> that we are guilty of; 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is in us <hi>ab Origine,</hi> from our <hi>first Being;</hi> 3. And because it is the <hi>Origo</hi> of all our <hi>Actual Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. I call that also [ORIGINAL] (or <hi>part of Original Sin)</hi> which hath but the two later only; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Which is in us <hi>AB ORIGINE,</hi> from our first personal being; 2. Which is the <hi>Root</hi> or <hi>ORIGO</hi> in our selves of all our <hi>Actual Sins:</hi> And thus our <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> derived from our <hi>nearer Parents,</hi> and not from <hi>Adam,</hi> is our <hi>Original Sin;</hi> That is, 1. Both <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> are in us from our <hi>Original,</hi> or first Being; 2. And all our Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sin springeth from it as a partial Cause: For I may presume that this Reverend Doctor doth not hold that <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin derived to us is in one <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> (which is not partible) and our nearer <hi>Parent</hi>'s in another; but will grant that it is <hi>one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosity</hi> that is derived from both, the latter being a Degree added to the former; though the <hi>Reatus</hi> having more than <hi>one fundamentum,</hi> may be called <hi>diverse.</hi> That <hi>Origo &amp; Active &amp; passive dicitur,</hi> I suppose we are agreed. Now I call the <hi>vicious Habits</hi> contracted from our nearer Parents by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reason of <hi>their own sins,</hi> superadded to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which else we should have derived from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61305:123"/>
                        <hi>Adam,</hi> a <hi>part</hi> of our <hi>original sinful Pravity,</hi> even a secondary part. And I call our <hi>guilt</hi> of the sins of our <hi>nearer Parents</hi> (not <hi>Adam</hi>'s) which you will, either a <hi>secondary Original Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> or a secondary <hi>part</hi> of our <hi>Original Guilt.</hi> See then our dangerous disagreement: I call that ORIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL, which is in us <hi>ab Origine,</hi> when we are first Persons, and is partly the Root or <hi>Origo</hi> in us of all our following Actual Sin: though it was not the <hi>Original Sin</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> or the first of Sins. The Doctor thinks this an Expression, which all <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> must be warned to take heed of, and to take heed of the Doctrine of him that useth it. The Allarm is against this dangerous word <hi>[ORIGINAL].</hi> And let a Man awake tell us what is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>But I would bring him yet to agreement even <hi>de nomine,</hi> though it anger him. 1. Let him read the <hi>Artic.</hi> 9. <hi>of the Church of England,</hi> and seeing there <hi>Original Sin</hi> is said to be that <hi>corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereby we are far gone from Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and <hi>are of our own Nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit.

                     <p n="2">2. If this will not serve, if he will find me any Text of Scripture, which useth the Phrase, <hi>[ORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINAL Sin],</hi> I will promise him hereafter to

                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>doubtless,</hi> many that seem killed by such Blows as some of yours, are still alive?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Young-Men, after long sad Experience of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miserable Contentions of the Clergie, and consequently of the Christian World, that you may escape the Guilt, I beseech you, whoever contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth it, consider and believe these following Notices:</hi> 1. <hi>That all Words are but arbitrary Signs, and are changed as Men please; and through the Penury of them, and Mans imperfection in the Art of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61305:134"/>
                        <hi>there are very few at all, that have not various Significations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Speaking-Art requireth so much time and study, and all Men are so defective in it, and the variety of Mens skill in it is so very great, that no Men in the World do perfectly agree in their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and use of Words.</hi> The doleful plague of the Confusion of Tongues, doth still hinder our full Communication, and maketh it hard for us to understand Words our selves, or to be understood by others; for <hi>Words</hi> must have a three-fold apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Signification. 1. To <hi>signifie</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> 2. And the <hi>Speakers conceptions</hi> of it. 3. And this as adapted to the hearers Mind, to make a true Impression there.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That God in Mercy hath not made <hi>Words</hi> so necessary as <hi>Things,</hi> nor necessary but for the sake of the <hi>Things:</hi> If <hi>God, Christ, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> be known, believed, and duly accepted, you shall be saved by what Words soever it be brought to pass.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Therefore <hi>Real Fundamentals,</hi> or <hi>Necessaries to Salvation,</hi> are more easily defined than <hi>Verbal ones:</hi> For <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> Words, <hi>these</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Words are needful to help <hi>some</hi> Persons, to Faith, and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> as their Capacities are different.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But as he that truly <hi>believeth in,</hi> and <hi>giveth up</hi> himself to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, according to the sense of the Baptismal Covenant, is a true Christian, to be loved, and shall be saved; so he that understandeth <hi>such Words,</hi> as help him to that true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> doth know so much of the <hi>Verbal part,</hi> as is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61305:134"/> to his Christianity and Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>And he that is such, holdeth no Heresie or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror inconsistent with it: If he truly love God, it's a contradiction to say, that he holdeth an Error incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Love of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Therefore see that you Love all such as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, till some proved or notorious inconsistents nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Profession disoblige you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Take your selves to be neither of Roman, or any other Church as Ʋniversal, which is less than the Ʋniversality of all Christians headed by Christ alone.</hi>

                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Make this Love of all Christians the second part of your Religion, and the Love of God, of Christ, of Holiness and Heaven, the first; and live thus in the serious practice of your Covenant, even of Simple Christianity: For it's this that will be your Peace, in Life and at Death.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> hold, that there are some <hi>Duties and common Grace,</hi> usually <hi>preparatory</hi> to Conversion (or Sanctification); which some <hi>Papists (de nomine)</hi> call <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Congruity,</hi> and some will not.

                        <hi>Doctors separate from the Church of</hi> Rome! viz. <hi>Because we make Good-Works necessary to the First Justification, which unless equivocally spoken, is false; and because the Protestants rank them with Inherent Holiness, as we do].</hi> What greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will they desire against us, than to choose us such Advocates?

                     <p>But may not I think that you take the word <hi>[Justification]</hi> here in the <hi>Protestant Sense,</hi> and not in the <hi>Papists,</hi> when you say that they <hi>rank Good-work's-necessity as stretcht to the First Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi> No sure: For, 1.

If it were so, it were not true: For the First <hi>Justification</hi> in the Protestant Sense, is our <hi>first right</hi> to <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, freely given to Believers, for the Merits of Christs perfect Righteousness and Satisfaction.</hi> And Papists do not make <hi>Good-works</hi> (unless Equivocally so called) necessary to this; but as a Fruit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>

That most commonly by that word the Papists mean nothing, but that which we call <hi>Mortification,</hi> or Putting away, or destroying the Sin it self, as to the habit and ceasing the Act. 2. That most of them are not resolved, where the <hi>Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Punishment</hi> (which Protestants call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sin,</hi> or <hi>Forgiveness)</hi> shall be placed: They differ not much as to its <hi>Time,</hi> but whether it be to be called any <hi>part of Justification:</hi> Some say, yea; some make it a <hi>distinct thing.</hi> Most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>Justification</hi> by it self, as consisting in our <hi>Remission</hi> of, or Deliverance from Sin it self, and the infused habit of Love or Righteousness (all which we call Sanctification), and the <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Penalty</hi> by it self, not medling with the Question, whether the latter be any part of the former; so much are they at a loss in the Notional part among themselves.

Where you <hi>called me to seriousness</hi> or <hi>diligence</hi> in my <hi>search,</hi> and I told <hi>you</hi> by what, and how many Writings, I have manifested my almost thirty years <hi>Diligence</hi> in this Controversie, and that I am now grown past more <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> Studies; that I might shew you what a trifling way it is, for a Man to wrangle with him that hath written so many things, to tell the World what his studies of this Point have been, and never to touch them, but to call him a<hi>-new</hi> to <hi>serious</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: You now expostulate with me, whether you <hi>accused</hi> me <hi>for want of diligence?</hi> I talk not of <hi>Accusing,</hi> but I tell you, that I have done my best; and that it were a poor kind of dealing with your self, if you had written against many, as you have done against me twenty five years ago, and very often, if instead of taking any notice of your Labours, I should call you now to diligent Studies.</p>
                     <p>As for your Lesson, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. that <hi>tumbling over many Books without meditation, may breed but Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,</hi> &amp;c. It is very true, and the calamity of too many of the literate Tribe, who think that they have deserved Credit and Reverence, when they say the words which others, whom they would be joyned with, have said before them: Want of good Digestion is a common Disease of many that never complain of it, nor feel any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent trouble by it.</p>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 22, 23. You insinuate that about <hi>Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which I before detected: I told you when, and where, I <hi>Suspended</hi> or <hi>Retracted</hi> the Book,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61305:139"/> and for what Reasons, and you presently feign a Retractation of the Doctrine, and <hi>of about sixty Books</hi> of Retractions.</p>
                     <p>It's well that <hi>pag.</hi> 23. you had the justice not to justifie your <hi>[Nec dubito quin imputatam Christi justitiam incluserit];</hi> But to confess your Injustice, was too much: It is not your <hi>own Retractation</hi> that you are for, it seems.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Definition of Justification, is either our <hi>Distinct knowledg,</hi> or <hi>Expression</hi> of it: Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not our <hi>Distinct knowledg,</hi> or <hi>Expression</hi> of it: Therefore the Definition of Justification, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, are not the same.</p>
                     <p>Justification <hi>In sensu activo,</hi> is not an Act of God, and <hi>In sensu passivo,</hi> is the Relative state of Man thereby effected: But the Definition of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is neither.</p>
                     <p>The Definition of Justification, is a work of Art; but Justification is a Work of Grace.</p>
                     <p>A wicked damnable Man, or a damned Devil, may <hi>define</hi> Justification, and so have the <hi>Definition</hi> of it; but not Justification it self.</p>
                     <p>The Definition of Justification, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Quid Logicum;</hi> but <hi>Justification, Faith, Love,</hi> &amp;c. are things <hi>Physical</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Man is Justified (or hath Christs Righteousness imputed to him) in his sleep, and when he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                        <hi>Other things</hi> be not the same Really with their Definition, therefore neither is <hi>Justification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>By this time you have helpt Men to understand by an Instance, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> so much warneth Christians to take heed lest any deceive them by vain Philosophy, even by Sophistry, and abused ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Notions.</p>
                     <p>Remember, Sir, that our Case is of grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; As it is stated in my <hi>Direct.</hi> 42. which you assaulted; it is <hi>[Whether if the Question were of the Object of Predestination, of the nature of the Will's liberty, Divine concourse,</hi> and <hi>determining way of Grace, of the Definition of Justification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a few well studied Divines are not here to be preferred before Authority, and the major Vote.</hi> Such are my words. I assert, 1. That the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Justification, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. is a work of Art. 2. And I have many and many times told the World (which you seem to strike at) that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do not differ so much in their <hi>Real concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> as they do in their <hi>Definitions.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Definitions</hi> are made up of <hi>Ambiguous words,</hi> whose Explication they are not agreed in; and almost all Words are ambiguous till explained, and ambiguous Words are not fit to define, or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61305:142"/> be defined, till explained. And, 2. Because both selecting fit terms, and explaining them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, are works of Art, in which Men are unequal; and there is as great variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Conceptions, as of Faces. 3. And I have often said, That a <hi>Knowledg intuitive,</hi> or a <hi>Simple apprehension</hi> of a thing as <hi>Sensate,</hi> or an <hi>Internal experience,</hi> or <hi>Reflect act,</hi> and a general notion of some things, may prove the truth of Grace, and save Souls, and make us capable of Christian Love and Communion, as being true saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. 4. And consequently I have often said, that many a thousand Christians have <hi>Faith, Hope, Desire, Love, Humility, Obedience, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, Ʋnion with Christ,</hi> who can <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> none of these: Unless you will speak equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of <hi>Definition</hi> it self, and say as good <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,</hi> and as <hi>Gutherleth,</hi> and some other Romists, that <hi>Notitia intuitiva est definitio,</hi> who yet say but what I am saying, when they add, <hi>[Vel sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem instar definitionis].</hi> If all are without <hi>Faith, Love, Justification, Adoption,</hi> who cannot give a true Definition of them, how few will be saved? How much more then doth <hi>Learning</hi> to Mens sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than Grace? And <hi>Aristotle</hi> then is not so far below <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Spirit of Christ, as we (justly) believe.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61305:142"/> as they are an Answer to mine.</p>
                     <p>In a word, you go about by the abuse of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial <hi>Axiome</hi> of <hi>Definitions,</hi> 1. To sentence most Christians to Hell, and cast them into Desperation, as wanting the Grace which they cannot define. 2. And to destroy Christian Love and Concord, and tear the Church into as many Shreds, as there be diversities of Definitions used by them. 3. And you would tempt us to think much hardlier of your self, than we must or will do; as if your <hi>Faith, Justification,</hi> &amp;c. were unsound, because your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions are so.</p>
                     <p>I know that <hi>Ʋnius rei una tantum est Definitio,</hi> speaking, 1. Not of the <hi>Terms,</hi> but the <hi>Sense.</hi> 2.

Make not plain things dark, Sir: The use of Art is not shut the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and confound Mens Minds.

Why should you and I dispute thus about Matters of Fact?

Yea, let us take only such as by their Lives we commonly judg truly Godly Christians: And if all <hi>these</hi> give you <hi>one</hi> and a <hi>true</hi> definition of Justification, then do you tell them that <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> is no such difficult work, but ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

                     <p>I doubt not but you know how much difference there is among Learned Men about <hi>Definitions</hi> themselves in general: Whether they belong to Metaphysicks, Logicks, or Physicks?

Your urgent questioning here <hi>[Do you not mean your self?]</hi> doth but expose you to pity, by opening that which you might have concealed.</p>
                     <p>And to your Question I say, could I enable all Ignorant Men to know who are the best Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I should be the grand Benefactor of the World: But both the <hi>blessing of excellent Teachers,</hi> and also of <hi>acquaintance</hi> with them and <hi>their worth,</hi> is given by God, partly as it pleaseth Him, freely, even to the unworthy, and partly as a Reward to those that have been faithful in a little, and obeyed low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er helps; (for there is a <hi>Worthiness</hi> to be found in some Houses, where the Preacher cometh with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61305:150"/> voice of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>unworthiness,</hi> which oft depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Men of such Mercies.) Both absolutely <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> and also <hi>Rewarding-Grace,</hi> do here shew themselves.</p>
                     <p>But yet I add, 1. That <hi>Light</hi> is a <hi>self-demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating thing;</hi> and will not easily be hid. 2. And those that are the Children of Light, and have been true to former helps and convictions, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to sell all for the Pearl, and fear not being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers by the price of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> but would have it whatever Labour or Suffering it must cost, and who search for it impartially and diligently, and forfeit it not by Sloth, or a fleshly, proud, or worldly Mind, these, I say, are prepared to discern the Light; when others fall under the heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being deceived by the <hi>Wranglings, Scorns, Clamours</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of PROUD IGNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE. And thus one <hi>Augustine</hi> was a Light in his time, and though such as <hi>Prosper, Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> &amp;c. knew him, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the <hi>Massilienses</hi> wrangled against him: And <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Bucer, Phagius, Zuinglius, Calvin, Musculus, Zanchius</hi> were such in their times; and some discerned them to be so, and more did not: If Men must have gone by the judgment of Rulers, or the major Vote of Teachers, what had become of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? If you can better direct Men how to discern Gods Gifts and Graces in His Servants, do it, and do not cavil against it.</p>

Did Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> agree with <hi>Lucius and Piscator,</hi> when he wrote against both (as the extreams)? Did Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> and <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> agree with Mr. <hi>G.

And many instead of <hi>[Imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness]</hi> put <hi>[Accepting us as Righteous, for the sake, or merit of Christs Righteousness imputed]</hi> (viz. as the <hi>Meritorious Cause).</hi> And <hi>Paraeus</hi> tells us, that they are of four Opinions, who are for <hi>Christs Righteousness imputed;</hi> some for the <hi>Passive</hi> only; some for the <hi>Passive</hi> and <hi>Active;</hi> some for the <hi>Passive, Active,</hi> and <hi>Habitual;</hi> some for these three and the <hi>Divine.</hi> And who knoweth not that some here so distinguish Causes and Effects, as that our <hi>Original Sin</hi> (or <hi>Habitual</hi> say some) is pardoned for Christs <hi>Original</hi> (and <hi>Habitual)</hi> Holiness: Our <hi>Omissions</hi> for <hi>Christs Active Obedience,</hi> and our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions</hi> for His <hi>Passive?</hi> Or as more say that Christs <hi>Passive Righteousness</hi> as Satisfaction, saveth us from Hell or Punishment, and His <hi>Active</hi> as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, procureth <hi>Life</hi> as the reward? When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, rejecting that Division, say; That both freedom from Punishment, and right to Glory are the conjunct effects of His Habitual, Active, and Passive Righteousness, as an entire Cause (in its kind); as <hi>Guil.

                     <p>Should I here set together forty or sixty Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Protestants verbatim, and shew you how
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61305:157"/> much they differ, it would be unpleasant, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unnecessary.</p>
                     <p>And as to those same Divines that Dr. <hi>Tully</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as agreed, Dr. <hi>Davenants</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> words I have cited at large in my <hi>Confes.</hi> saying the same in substance as I do; as also Mr. <hi>Scudders,</hi> and an hundred more, as is before said.</p>
                     <p>And let any sober Reader decide this Controversie between us, upon these two further Considerations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Peruse all the <hi>Corpus Confessionum,</hi> and see whether all the Reformed Churches give us a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Justification, and agree in that Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: Yea, whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its Catechism, or its Articles, have any proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition: Or if you will call their words a <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> I am sure it's none but what I do consent to. And if a <hi>Logical Definition</hi> were by the Church of <hi>England</hi> and other Churches held <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, it would be in their Catechisms (if not in the Creed): Or if it were held necessary to Church-Concord, and Peace, and Love, it would be in their Articles of Religion, which they subscribe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How can all Protestants agree of the <hi>Logical Definition</hi> of Justification, when 1. They agree not of the sense of the word <hi>[Justifie,]</hi> and of the <hi>species</hi> of that Justification which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> speak of? Some make Justification to include Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Sanctification, (see their words in <hi>G. Forbes,</hi> and <hi>Le Blank);</hi> many say otherwise. Most say that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh most usually of Justification in <hi>sensu forensi,</hi> but whether it include <hi>[Making just]</hi> as some say, or only <hi>[Judging just]</hi> as others, or <hi>Nolle punire,</hi> be the act as Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> they agree not. And some hold that in <hi>James Justification</hi> is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61305:157"/> that which is <hi>coram hominibus,</hi> when said to be by <hi>Works;</hi> but others <hi>(truly)</hi> say, it is that <hi>coram Deo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are not agreed in their very <hi>Logical Rules,</hi> and Notions, to which their Definitions are reduced; no not so much as of the number and nature of Causes, nor of <hi>Definitions</hi> (as is aforesaid): And as I will not undertake to prove that all the Apostles, Evangelists and Primitive Pastours, knew how to define <hi>Efficient, Material, Formal</hi> and <hi>Final Causes</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> so I am sure that <hi>all</hi> good Christians do not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And when <hi>Justification</hi> is defined by Divines, is either the <hi>Actus Justificantis,</hi> and this being in the predicament of Action, what wonder if they disagree about the <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal Causes</hi> of it?</p>
                     <p>Nay, it being an Act of God, there are few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that tell us what that Act is: <hi>Deus operatur per essentiam:</hi> And <hi>Ex parte agentis,</hi> his Acts are his <hi>Essence,</hi> and all but one. And who will thus dispute of the Definition and Causes of them, Efficient, Material, Formal, Final? when I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to declare, that this Act of Justifying is not an immanent Act in God, nor without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, but Gods Act by the Instrumentality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f his <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promise,</hi> many read it as a new thing; and if that hold true that the First Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith, is that which Gods Gospel-Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Instrument of, as the <hi>Titulus seu Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Juris,</hi> being but a <hi>Virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d not an Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sentence, then the Definition of it, as to the Causes, must differ much from the most common Definitions.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61305:158"/>
                     <p> But most Protestants say that <hi>Justification</hi> is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Judicis.</hi> (And no doubt but there are three several <hi>sorts</hi> or Acts called Justification, 1. Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive by the <hi>Donative Covenant,</hi> 2. <hi>Sentential,</hi> 3. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive.)</hi> And here they are greatly at a loss, for the dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> saith it is a <hi>Sentence</hi> in <hi>Heaven notifying</hi> it to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: But that is not all, or the chief: some run back to an Imma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent Act; most leave it undetermined: And sure the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Sentence</hi> in general, signifieth no true Conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion of it at all, in him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what that <hi>Sentence</hi> is, seeing Universals are <hi>Nothing</hi> (out of us) but as they exist in individuals. Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> hath said that wihch would reconcile Protestants, and some Papists, as to the Name, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods <hi>Execution</hi> is his <hi>Sentence;</hi> He <hi>Judgeth</hi> by <hi>Executing:</hi> And so as the chief punishment is the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spirit,</hi> so the Justifying Act, is the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive donation</hi> of the Spirit. Thus are we disagreed about <hi>Active Justification</hi> (which I have oft endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Conciliatorily fullier to open.)</p>
                     <p>And as to <hi>Passive Justification</hi> (or as it is <hi>Status Justificati)</hi> which is indeed that which it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in this Controversie to open, I have told you how grosly some describe it here before. And all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not what <hi>Predicament</hi> it is in: some take it to be in that of <hi>Action, ut recipitur in passo;</hi> and some in that of Quality and Relation Conjunct: But most
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61305:158"/> place it in Relation; And will you wonder if all Christian Women, yea or Divines, cannot define that Relation aright. And if they agree not in the notions of the <hi>Efficient, Material, Formal and Final Causes,</hi> of that which must be <hi>defined</hi> (as it is capable) by its <hi>subjectum, fundamentum</hi> and <hi>terminus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would not wish that the Salvation of any Friend of mine (or any one) should be laid on the true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Definition of Justification, Active or Passive, <hi>Constitutive, Sentential</hi> or <hi>Executive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now the Judicious will see, whether the Church and Souls of Men be well used by this pretence, that all Protestants are agreed in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Causes</hi> and Definition of Justification; and that to depart from that <hi>one</hi> Definition (where is it?) is so dangerous as the Doctor pretendeth, because the <hi>Definition</hi> and the <hi>Definitum</hi> are the same.</p>

He tells me, that <hi>[I seem not to understand my own Question, nor to know well how to set about my Work];</hi> and he will teach me how to manage the <hi>Business</hi> that <hi>I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,</hi> and so he tells me <hi>how</hi> I MUST state the Question hereafter, (see his words). Reader, some Reasons may put a better Title on this Learned Doctors actions; but if ever I write at this rate, I heartily desire thee to cast it away as utter DISHONESTY and IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUDENCE.</p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61305:167"/>
                     <p> It troubleth me to trouble thee with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions. I hold, 1. That <hi>Adams</hi> Sin is imputed (as I opened) to his Posterity. 2. That the degree of Pravity which <hi>Cains</hi> nature received from <hi>Adam,</hi> was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive enclining Cause of all his Actual Sin: 3. But not a necessitating Cause of <hi>all those</hi> Acts; for he might possibly have done less evil and more good than he did. 4. Therefore not the <hi>Total principal Cause;</hi> for <hi>Cains free-will</hi> was <hi>part</hi> of that. 5. <hi>Cains actual sin increased</hi> the <hi>pravity</hi> of his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 6. And <hi>Cains Posterity</hi> were (as I opened it) <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Cains actual sin;</hi> and their <hi>Natures</hi> were the more <hi>depraved</hi> by his <hi>additional pravity,</hi> than they would have been by <hi>Adams sin alone</hi> (unless <hi>Grace preserved</hi> or <hi>healed</hi> any of them).</p>
                     <p>The Doctor in this Paper, would make his Reader believe that he is <hi>[for no meer Logomachies]</hi> and that the difference is not in <hi>words only,</hi> but <hi>the thing.</hi> And do you think that he differeth from me in any of these Propositions, or how this <hi>sin is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from</hi> Adam? Yet this now must be the Controversie <hi>de re.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you think (for I must go by <hi>thinking)</hi> that he holdeth any other <hi>Derivation</hi> than this? Or did I ever deny any of this?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61305:168"/> But it is vain to state the Case to him: He will over-look it, and tell me what I <hi>should have</hi> held, that he may not be thought to make all this Noise for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>He saith <hi>pag</hi> 8. <hi>[If it derive in a direct line from the first Transgression, and have its whole Root fastened there, what then? why then some words which he sets together are not the best sense that can be spoken.</hi> It is then but <hi>words,</hi> and yet it is the <hi>thing:</hi> What he may mean by [a <hi>direct Line],</hi> and what by <hi>[whole Root fastened]</hi> I know not; but I have told the World oft enough <hi>what I mean;</hi> and what <hi>he meaneth,</hi> I have little to do with.</p>
                     <p>But if he think, 1. That <hi>Adams Person</hi> did commit the sin of <hi>Cain,</hi> and of all that ever were since committed; and that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das his act,</hi> was <hi>Adams personal act.</hi> 2. Or that <hi>Adams sin</hi> was a <hi>total</hi> or <hi>necessitating</hi> Cause of all the evil since committed; so do not I, (nor doth he, I doubt not).

                     <p>The Reader may see that I mentioned <hi>[Actual Sin, and Guilt]:</hi> And I think few will doubt, but <hi>Adams [Actual sin,</hi> and <hi>Cains,]</hi> were divers; and that therefore, the <hi>Guilt</hi> that <hi>Cains</hi> Children had of <hi>Adams</hi> sin and of <hi>Cains</hi> was not the same: But that <hi>Causa causae</hi> is <hi>Causa causati,</hi> and so that all following Sin was <hi>partly</hi> (but <hi>partly) caused</hi> by <hi>Adam's,</hi> we shall soon agree.</p>
                     <p>He addeth that I must make good that <hi>new Original Sin</hi> (for he can make use of the word <hi>New,</hi> and therefore <hi>made</hi> it) <hi>doth mutare naturam, as the Old doth. Ans.</hi> And how far it <hi>changeth it,</hi> I told him, and he taketh no notice of it: The <hi>first sin</hi> changed Nature from <hi>Innocent</hi> into <hi>Nocent;</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> changeth it from <hi>Nocent into more Nocent:</hi> Doth he deny this? Or why must I prove any more? Or doth nothing but Confusion please him?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He saith, I must prove that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of Progenitors sins is constant and necessary, not uncertain and contingent.</hi>

                        <p>I am glad you begin with this Distinction, that I may have my apprehensions of it more fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; where they are right, confirmed; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, that they may be changed. For I confess, I make use of this Distinction, as a Key to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of very many points in Divinity, to which it is not commonly applied. The confounding of our Ethicks and Physicks, and so of their distinct Fountains, doth introduce confusion into the main Body of Theology, with those that are guilty of it: And it is easie to conceive, that it is necessary to the understanding of Theological Controversies, to avoid that confusion, and know to which of these the Question doth belong. It is easie to conceive what work it would make in <hi>Philosophical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, to confound our <hi>Physicks</hi> and <hi>Ethicks;</hi> and it will have no better effect in <hi>Theological.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I take <hi>Debitum</hi> to be the direct proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our <hi>Ethicks;</hi> and <hi>Ens Reale,</hi> of our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks (for I take not the term [Physicks] in the common restrained sense, as its Object is <hi>only Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Naturale;</hi> but as it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as some call Metaphysicks, and containeth <hi>much of Metaphysicks,</hi> (for I conceive that which treateth <hi>de Eute Reali</hi> should be one entire Doctrine) <hi>Pneumaticks,</hi> and <hi>common Physicks all:</hi> So I take <hi>[Ethicks]</hi> in so large a sence, as to comprehend <hi>Oeconomicks, Politicks,</hi> and all <hi>Morality:)</hi> So I do distinguish of <hi>God's Will</hi> here, according to these <hi>different Objects.</hi> As <hi>Ens Reale,</hi> is the <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Product</hi> of his Will, for want of a better name, I call it, his <hi>Decretive Will,</hi> or <hi>Will of Purpose:</hi> And because in most of our Theological Discourses, we are fain to speak of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61305:172"/> God's Will, according to the imperfect manner of mans will, as if it respected its Object as present, past, future; therefore <hi>Res futurae, &amp; Rerum futuritio</hi> are usually made the Objects, or Products of God's <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Purpose</hi> (for man <hi>purposeth</hi> only <hi>de futuro:)</hi> (And indeed <hi>quoad hominem,</hi> the thing being <hi>truly future,</hi> so <hi>God</hi> may be said to <hi>Decree</hi> that <hi>quoad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem</hi> it <hi>shall be future;</hi> though <hi>quoad ipsum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um non est futurum.)</hi> But I sometime say, <hi>Eventus</hi> is the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>this Will;</hi> meaning thereby <hi>Res eveniens,</hi> and so connecting the <hi>Thing</hi> with its Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from its first Cause; and intending the Comprehension of all Beings, past, present, and future. And also, that I may comprehend <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which as they are <hi>Reductively</hi> belonging to the Doctrine of <hi>Beings;</hi> so may they also to the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>God's Will de Eventu.</hi> For as <hi>mans Will</hi> may be <hi>de Agere vel non Agere, de esse vel non esse;</hi> so we may conceive of <hi>God's Will:</hi> (Though <hi>Scotus</hi> hath shewed the truth of this Conception to be very disputable.) Therefore when I say that <hi>Ens Reale</hi> is the <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Product</hi> of <hi>this Will</hi> of God, I mean both the <hi>Esse &amp; non Esse, Beings and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;</hi> but one <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> the other but <hi>consequenter &amp; reductivè:</hi> As in saying <hi>Debitum</hi> is the <hi>Object,</hi> or rather <hi>Product</hi> of God's <hi>Ethical,</hi> or <hi>Legislative Will,</hi> I mean both the <hi>Debere &amp; non De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere;</hi> but the former only <hi>directly,</hi> the latter but <hi>indirectly, consequenter &amp; reductivè;</hi> as proceeding only from God's <hi>non-commanding</hi> or <hi>prohibiting,</hi> and properly being <hi>Nothing,</hi> and having <hi>no Cause</hi> in Morality: I mean, the <hi>[Non-d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. So that by God's <hi>Decretive Will,</hi> I mean only his <hi>Will de Eventu, vel de Ente qua tali;</hi> and by his <hi>Legislative Will,</hi> I mean only his <hi>Will de Debito:</hi> So that I primarily distinguish of the <hi>Objects,</hi> or <hi>Products</hi> of God's Will; and thence of <hi>his Will it self.</hi> This I expressed fully in my Aphorisms: So that my main scope is, but to keep open the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Naturality,</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> in all our Discourses.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And I have there also manifested, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take the Act of Willing in God to be the same in both. <hi>Velle Debitum,</hi> is as properly <hi>Velle,</hi> as is <hi>Velle Eventum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. And that I distinguish of the Objects here, but <hi>formaliter:</hi> For <hi>Debitum</hi> is <hi>Ens quoddam</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Though I think, as <note place="margin">God's Will is, 1. <hi>De Ente in genere.</hi> 2. <hi>In specie,</hi> 1. <hi>De Ente Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali.</hi> 2. <hi>De Ente Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali; i. e.

                        <p n="4">4.

I also (and principally) shewed you, that I comprehend two things in my phrase of <hi>[God's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Will,]</hi> or <hi>[his Will de Debito:]</hi> 1. The <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Will</hi> of God <hi>de Debito;</hi> which is as true, and as Eternal an Act, as his <hi>Velle Eventum.</hi> 2. The <hi>signal Will</hi> of God, which is <hi>his Law:</hi> This I told you, I call <hi>his Will</hi> but <hi>Metonymically.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Both these together, and neither alone, do <hi>Constituere Debitum;</hi> 1. Not God's <hi>Immanent act alone,</hi> or directly; for it is not properly <hi>Lex,</hi> till it be <hi>signified;</hi> much less <hi>Lex promulgata.</hi> 2. Nor the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>signum</hi> considered in it self, abstracted from the <hi>Will signified;</hi> but only considered <hi>Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ut signum,</hi> and so with its correlate; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Immanent Will signified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. My full meaning therefore is, but to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>God's Law,</hi> from his <hi>other Acts and Works.</hi> But I choose to call it <hi>[his Legislative Will,]</hi> rather than <hi>[his Law:]</hi> 1. Lest it should be thought I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude only the <hi>Law materially,</hi> and exclude the <hi>Immanent Will,</hi> which was from Eternity <hi>de Debito.</hi> 2. Because if I should distinguish between <hi>[God's Will,]</hi> and <hi>[his Law]</hi> it would plainly sound as if I contradistinguished his <hi>whole Will</hi> from <hi>his Law,</hi> and so even his <hi>Will de Debito,</hi> which is the <hi>Soul of his Law,</hi> the <hi>Signum</hi> being but the <hi>Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. And I fully told you, that therefore I call it his <hi>[Legislative Will,]</hi> rather than (as others hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto) his <hi>[Will of Precept;]</hi> because <hi>the Law</hi> hath <hi>several parts,</hi> which constitute a <hi>several Debitum: Precept</hi> is but <hi>one</hi> of these parts, but I speak of <hi>all.</hi> The false Definitions of <hi>Law</hi> have long wronged the World; while men reduced it all to <hi>Precept,</hi>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61305:174"/> or to be <hi>Regula actionum moralium.</hi> The Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth (in the large, and yet proper sence, as I will take Law) <hi>de omni Debito, Moraliter &amp; propriè sic dicto:</hi> 1. What shall be <hi>due from us;</hi> that is, in the <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Prohibition.</hi> 2. What shall be <hi>due to us;</hi> that is, in, 1. The <hi>Promise.</hi> 2. The <hi>Threat:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Fundamental Distributions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that the Product of God's <hi>Legislative Will,</hi> is, 1. <hi>Debitum rei libere &amp; absolutè Donatae.</hi> 2. <hi>Debitum officii nostri (in agendo &amp; non-agendo.)</hi> 3. <hi>Debitum praemii.</hi> 4. <hi>Debitum poenae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus I have all close together, and once again told you my meaning (as plain as I can with bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity) in this Distinction. And understand, that I undertake not to shew you how far other mens sence of it is the same with mine: But our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, Whether this that I have opened, be the Schoolmens sence of their Distinction of <hi>[Voluntas signi &amp; Beneplaciti?]</hi> I conclude, that it is not, and that for these <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Implere &amp; permittere naturaliter (ut à permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione morali distinguitur)</hi> which are some of their <hi>signa,</hi> are utterly unreducible to this Legislative Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Both the terms of their Distinction, and their Explication, shew that they intend not to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish God's Will <hi>ab objectis; Event and Right:</hi> But as it is <hi>in it self,</hi> and as it is manifested to us: And therefore <hi>Voluntas signi</hi> with them, is <hi>Voluntas significata,</hi> or <hi>signum Voluntatis:</hi> But not one act of that Will signified as distinct from another (as to our apprehension;) but the same that is before termed <hi>Veluntas Beneplaciti,</hi> is it as signified. And therefore some of them do again subdistinguish their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61305:174"/>
                           <hi>five signs,</hi> noting, that some of them <hi>(Praeceptum, prohibitio, Consilium)</hi> do determine <hi>Duty;</hi> and the other signifie <hi>Event.</hi> So <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> himself more fully and <note place="margin">

And so they may as well subdistinguish the <hi>Voluntas Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neplaciti,</hi> into <hi>Beneplacitum de Eventu, &amp; de Debito.</hi> I could by multitudes of their sayings, manifest this that I say, of the plain importance of their words, were it not a vain loss of time and labour, specially to you that I know have so frequently read it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And therefore they use the Distinction of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas secreta &amp; revelata,</hi> as the same in sence with <hi>Beneplaciti &amp; signi:</hi> But it is not the same with <hi>mine;</hi> for <hi>Voluntas de Eventu est partim secreta partim (in prophetiis &amp; Causis secundis) revelata.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. And they plainly exclude the <hi>Immanent Act of God's Will de Debito,</hi> from their <hi>Vol. signi,</hi> by the very name. For the <hi>Immanent Act</hi> is not <hi>sui ipsius signum nec alterius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. And as plainly do they exclude it by saying, that <hi>Volunt. signi</hi> is but <hi>Metaphoricè God's Will,</hi> Whereas the <hi>Immanent Act</hi> is <hi>properly</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>signum</hi> is more <hi>Metonymice</hi> than <hi>Metaphoricè</hi> his <hi>Will.</hi> I think I needed no more proof; but if these convince you not, the matter is of very small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what <hi>they</hi> mean.

                        <p>Whether most Divines be of this judgment or not, I will not enquire: By divers passages in your Book you seem to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto it, but so cannot I for these Reasons:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Adam</hi> by his Transgression became liable to the second Death: Therefore if he had been obedient, he had enjoyed the happiness of the life to come. For the Reward of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence should have (it's likely) held proportion with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Disobedience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It seems incongruous, that a rational and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creature, being perfectly righteous, and holy, and every way obedient, should always lead an Animal and Natural
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61305:180"/> life and never attain to greater happiness than this life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Adam</hi> persevering in the state of Innocency, should have procreated Children, and his Children other Children, and so on. Therefore if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity should always have lived upon the Earth, how, in an ordinary way of Providence, could the Earth have been able either to sustain, or support all that ever should be born, all from the very first still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more and more continually succeeding to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? If you say, that after some continuance of time, the Propagation of Mankind should have ceased; <hi>viz.</hi> when the Earth was so full, that it could well bear no more: Where doth the Scripture warrant this conceit? Rather it intimateth, that many having lived some time upon Earth, should have been translated into Heaven.</p>
                        <p>For, 4. It seems that Paradise was a Type of Heaven, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, if he had kept his first estate, should have been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated: And that the Tree of Life was a Type of Eternal Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. &amp; 22. 14. And though I like not to be peremptory in things of this nature, yet there may seem to be some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in that opinion, which some of old have entertained; <hi>viz.</hi> That if man had not faln into Disobedience, he should have lived a thousand years upon Earth, and then have been conveyed to Heaven. For though <hi>Adam,</hi> and divers of his Off-spring, lived many hundred years, yet neither he, nor any after him, did reach unto a thousand. See Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> p. 284 <hi>Edit. Lat.</hi>

                        <p>Here are two Questions to be considered: 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> should have been translated to Heaven by a <hi>Local removal?</hi> This is it that I saw no Scripture for, or convincing Reason, and therefore durst not affirm, nor receive as certain. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> should have attained to a far higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Happiness in that Paradise he then was in, by God's fuller manifestation of himself to him, as to the Saints in Heaven: This I never denied, nor yet affirmed, nor medled with. And indeed, since I wrote that Book, I am grown to a greater doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61305:180"/> of the whole; and will not now dare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or deny either of the Questions. For I do not know so much as to make me any thing confident. I confess while I looked merely at express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-words, I was loth to affirm what Scripture affirmed not; and therefore inclined to the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the first Question. But since, upon the consideration <note place="margin">It is long since this was written, and since I have been fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made for Heaven, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

From many Scripture-texts, which describe <hi>Redemption</hi> in words importing our Restauration to a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness which we lost, as to the title and hopes of it. Therefore I hope my doubting then, will further no ones doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> of the drift and reason of Scripture-Doctrine, I am much staggered. And indeed, that which staggered me was none of the common Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought against M. <hi>Ball, Gataker, Camero,</hi> and the rest that go that way that I then did; but the mere Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>de fine,</hi> and how far it is Natural, and how far not, as I was seriously reading <hi>Scotus, Rada,</hi> and others, of that weighty, knotty subject. I dare not now be so bold, as to affirm, That <hi>Adam</hi> was created <hi>in Patriâ,</hi> and not <hi>in Viâ;</hi> that is, in the full fruition of his Happiness; rather in the way to it, with an imperfect taste of it. But especially I am very jealous lest I should give advantage to Infidelity, and the denial of the Glory of the Saints in Heaven, if I should go too far in asserting the Supernaturality of it.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61305:181"/> capable of such a Blessedness: And if he had a <hi>Potentia Naturalis</hi> to it, then it would seem that it was not given him in vain; and that he had not attained the perfection that he was made for, if he had not attained all that he was made <hi>Potentialiter</hi> capable of. Some more such School-Reasons of late have staggered me in this, and made me most incline to think, that <hi>Adam</hi> should have had the same, or near the same degree of Glory as we. But yet I have much to say on the other side: However, I little know where he should have enjoyed it, or how removed to it, if removed. I must needs therefore confess my ignorance here, till God be pleased to remove it. But I confess I had before thought on your Reasons, and they seemed not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to me: For. 1. If by the second Death, you mean the same degree of Punishment which is due to the Despisers of Christ, I deny that <hi>Adam</hi> was liable to it: If you mean, the perpetuating of his Souls sufferings, I grant it: But all that will thence follow is, that his felicity should have been perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, if he had not sinned. For it will not follow, that because <hi>Adam</hi> was to go to his perpetual Death, by the temporal Death which he had deserved, that therefore he was to go to Glory by a change, or removal. For the place where <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul should have suffered, none knows it. And 2. God could encrease <hi>Adam</hi>'s happiness, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval by a fuller Manifestation of himself to him.

                        <p>You should say, <hi>[No more than the life then promised is the same,</hi> &amp;c.] For otherwise your Comparison is not equal. Now to me it is more than probable, for the Reasons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged, That the Life promised in the first Covenant, was the same with that which the New-Covenant doth promise, and consequently, that the same Death and Damnation (for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) is threatned in both Covenants. And do not many yet lie under the first Covenant, and that shall be punished merely as Transgressors of that Covenant, the New-Covenant having never so much as been made known unto them? See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. And shall not the Damnation of such, be (for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) the same with the Damnation of those that transgress the New-Covenant? Shall not both go to the same Hell, and endure the same Torment, though not in the same degree? <hi>See</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Append.</hi> p. 10. you argue thus, <hi>[If you say that</hi> Adam <hi>should have died, and rose again to Torment, what Scripture saith so?</hi> 2. <hi>Where should he have risen?</hi> 3. <hi>You contradict many Scriptures, which make Christ the Mediator the only Procurer of the Resurrection.]</hi>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Scripture sheweth, that man transgressing the first Covenant, should die the first Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61305:182"/> 3. 19. And not the first Death only, but also the second Death, if it be not prevented by that Mercy which is held out in the New-Covenant. <hi>The wages of sin is death,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And the Death which he speaketh of, is opposed to etrenal Life, which is the free-gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord; and therefore it must extend to that which the Scripture calls the second Death. And seeing the Body is co-partner with the Soul in the Transgression, it is not probable that the first Covenant doth denounce the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death only against the Soul, and not against the Body also, on which (after the Soul is separated from it) it cannot be inflicted without a Resurrection.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam,</hi> and so others, should have risen either (as now they shall) in the end of the World, or when it should have pleased God to raise them.</p>

                        <p>I confess that I then supposed there was no other Life promised, than that which was enjoyed; and that the right to it was from <hi>actual Collation,</hi> and not by <hi>Promise:</hi> My Reason was, because I found no such Promise. And most Divines say, that the words of the <hi>Commination implying</hi> a <hi>Promise,</hi> are our proof that it was <hi>a Covenant or Promise.</hi> Now I found no Promise certainly implied in the words of the Commination, but the continuance of that Life which he had.

Only thus much,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Covenant of Works doth not allow men (or God, according to that Covenant, doth not give men) such rich and numerous Mercies, as the poorest Indians do enjoy; therefore God dealeth not with them merely on the terms of the Covenant of Works.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Mercies given, according to the mere Covenant of Works, are not given to <hi>lead men to Repentance;</hi> (for it alloweth <hi>no Repentance,</hi> but that of <hi>Desperation:)</hi> But the Mercies that Pagans have are given to lead them to Repentance; therefore they are not given according to the mere Law of Works.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If Christ, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> shall <hi>judg all,</hi> then <hi>all</hi>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61305:183"/> are some-way of that Kingdom whereof he is King, and under those Laws by which he ruleth: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore not under the mere Law of Works.

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. which you cite, hath not the least colour for your Assertion, that I can see. The Law was of narrower extent, as to its Promulgation and Obligation, than the Grace of the Mediator is: Where doth God say, <hi>As many as have sinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy or Grace</hi> (that is, <hi>Mercy</hi> contra Meritum) <hi>shall perish without Mercy, or Grace?</hi> That is it that you should prove. And as little is, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8. to your purpose; which plainly speaketh of such as <hi>obey</hi>

                        <p>To that you say against the passage in my <hi>Append.</hi> p. 10. I reply, <hi>Adam</hi> should have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>perpetual Misery</hi> (call it first or second Death, as you please:) But your Conjecture at a Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the Bodies co-partnership, is no proof. Is it not as probable, that the Body being the Souls Instrument, and acted by it, that everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dissolution should have been its punishment, its nature being also more subject to Dissolution than the Souls; and that Dissolution being a real and grievous punishment? Doubtless it would have been a <hi>Privation of its Perfection,</hi> and that for sin, and therefore a punishment; and the Soul that was chief in sin, to have suffered perpetually, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its more durable nature. Philosophers commonly say, It is only the Soul that <hi>feels,</hi> and so <hi>suffers now,</hi> and not the <hi>Body it self.</hi> And if so, then the Body would not suffer pain hereafter, but only the <hi>Soul</hi> in that Body. But I am glad you seem not to be of <hi>Twisse</hi>'s opinion, that <hi>Melius est Miserum esse, quam non esse;</hi> or else you would not think it no punishment to the Body, to be for ever dissolved, while the Soul is tormented. But here I assert nothing, but only oppose Conjecture to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, waiting for your better proof, seeing you affirm. And,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Your second is a bare Affirmation, without one Scripture-proof, That <hi>Adam</hi> should have risen again. And,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But it follows, that seeing Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth no Resurrection but what is procured by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61305:184"/> Christ, that therefore it is to us uncertain, whether there should have been any. And if all should have risen, whether Christ had died and risen or not; then how will it appear, that any mans Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was purchased by Christ? For whereas you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish of Resurrection to Life and to Death, that is not <hi>de Re,</hi> but <hi>de Consequente.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Life</hi> following that Resurrection is then from Christ; But what need he procure a <hi>Resurrection</hi> for them which should rise <hi>without his procurement?</hi> And for the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22.

And indeed, Christ did not perform these to the same ends as sinners did, and as they were mainly intended for such in their Institution.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I said he was not bound to perform them <hi>[in regard of himself:]</hi> that is, <hi>[finaliter,</hi> he was no sinner, and had no sin to pardon of his own, nor any sinful wants to be supplied; and so had not those ends of his own to move or necessitate him to use them, as others had:] But he used them, both to shew his subjection, and take up that burthen of tedious Ceremonious-Worship, which justly lay on us; and also to give us an example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3.

To say therefore, That his Service, or Actions ceased to be <hi>Meritorious;</hi> is either to say, They lost their Dignity (which may not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;) or God ceased or failed to accept them as Meritorious and Satisfactory, and so broke his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (as we may call it) which is as little to be imagined. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s service (as service, and not only as suffering) deserved <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> &amp;c. never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless because he became bound to serve. Nay more, among just men, it is not only the wages agreed on by Covenants, that is deserved by a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servant; but if he do much more, and so benefit his Master more, he doth truly deserve more, and the just Master will pay him more; though not by virtue of the Obligation of the Covenant, yet by virtue of the Obligation of the Law of Nature,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61305:189"/> which is before it: So great is the difference between the service of one that doth voluntarily oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when he was <hi>sui juris;</hi> and one that is originally under your absolute Dominion: The one may sell you his service before hand, according to its value, which supposeth the future reality of that value and merit; but the other cannot, because he, and all that is his, is properly not his own, but yours.</p>
                        <p>Add to this what I before told you, that the Godhead was never subjected (either as to <hi>Propriety, ad Dominum;</hi> or to <hi>Obedience, ad Rectorem)</hi> in it self, but only it may by <hi>Communication</hi> be <hi>called subject:</hi> And therefore the Actions of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their <hi>chief Dignity</hi> from his <hi>chief Nature,</hi> which was never <hi>in it self subject,</hi> must needs be highly <hi>Meritorious,</hi> both, 1. Because of the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2. And of the Freedom of that Nature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And therefore I utterly deny your Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence on these grounds, and affirm still, That Christ's <hi>Active Righteousness, or Obedience, as such, is Meritorious and Satisfactory.</hi> And indeed, the Question should rather be, <hi>Whether it be only</hi> Poena Christi, <hi>or</hi> Obedientia <hi>also, that satisfieth and merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> (as I before hinted.)</p>

                        <p>But I think the Text means plainly, that God as mere Legislator of the Law of Works, judgeth no man, but hath given all judgment to the Son, as Redeemer and Legislator of, or Judg according to a Law of Grace, or on terms of Grace. It is not now <hi>Deus-Creator secundum foedus operum solum, sine Remedio: Sed Deus-Redemptor.</hi> I think I could give you good proofs of this Interpretation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

How can you call that the <hi>Rigorous execution,</hi> which would have prevented all the following <hi>sins</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> himself, and all the sin and suffering of his Posterity?

                        <p n="2">2. If we should speak of God, as of man, that must have time for his Consultations (which is not so;) and so that while he was consulting of the terms and way of our Redemption, he should in mere mercy suspend the execution: Yet, 1. That is not the Suspension that I now speak of. 2. Nor is that without respect to Redemption, but in order to it (if there were such a thing;) much less do I mean a continuance of a sinful miserable life, which is a preparative to greater punishments, which is rather the <hi>execution</hi> of the Sentence, than the <hi>suspension:</hi> But I mean all that which is <hi>properly a suspension,</hi> following Christ's <hi>interposition and undertaking:</hi> That God doth not while they live give them over to as much sinfulness and misery as they deserve, and as far abdicate them, and desert them by the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of all that may abate their misery, and that he gives them not over as forsaken to despair, and their lives on earth did not presently begin to be a Hell.

                        <p n="1">1. You should have said, It is not consistent with the words and Doctrine which I oppose; and that's no wonder.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I confest before, that here I put the word <hi>[Afflictions]</hi> instead of <hi>[Chastisements;]</hi> which I will not excuse, though custom may easily make it intelligible: For that Language is not singular. If therefore you mean it of Afflictions in general, I doubt not but they are more incident to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates than any; or else they should not be damned. If you mean it of <hi>[Chastisements,]</hi> I answer, 1. As God in a larger sence may be called the Father of all those to whom he sheweth mercy, provideth for them, beareth with them, offereth them Christ,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61305:197"/> and Grace, giveth them in his Covenant of Grace a conditional Adoption; and so far he may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Father of Mankind, or of Reprobates (as many Divines on the Preface of the Lord's Prayer:) And so far he may be said to love them, and to chastise them. But not in that strict sence, as he is the Father of Believers, and loveth and chastiseth them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. So far as God <hi>doth good</hi> to Reprobates, he loveth them. But he doth them good, he giveth them mercy. Else they never sin against mercy, which who dare say? therefore they may partake of loving punishments; no doubt punishments may do them good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yet will I not say, that these are <hi>sanctified</hi> to them. As if there were <hi>no good</hi> below that of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:</hi> But if you will needs extend the word <hi>[sanctified]</hi> to <hi>all good,</hi> I contend not. But till God lay by his Philanthropy, I will not say, he loves not all men, at least, in this life.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And if you had put the case of <hi>[Ʋnbelievers,]</hi> and not only of <hi>[Reprobates]</hi> it might easily have appeared, that they are <hi>loving punishments</hi> to <hi>many Ʋnbelievers; viz.</hi> to the Elect before Conversion (as <hi>Paul</hi>'s striking down by the way, and <hi>Manasseh</hi>'s chains were, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> for they are means of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; and in some sence may be said to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to them, and in another not. And yet God is not then strictly their Father (for they are not adopted till they receive Christ by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 10, 11.) and therefore they are not so fatherly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements. Where also you see, that it is not Christ's mere bearing the Curse for men, that makes it no Curse, or evil to them: For it is evil
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61305:198"/> and a Curse to many of the Elect, before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for whom yet Christ died.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. By <hi>[Curse]</hi> I mean, only the <hi>effect of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Law of Nature violated,</hi> commonly called <hi>[the Curse:]</hi> I do not mean that which makes a man so unhappy, as we use to call men <hi>[Cursed]</hi> for.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If sanctified suffering be not still <hi>malum,</hi> then it is not <hi>malum poenae;</hi> and then it is not <hi>poena</hi> [which is a <hi>natural evil insticted for the defect of Moral good:]</hi> But you maintain it to be <hi>poena.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It's a natural evil effecting accidentally a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Good. Here it remains still a <hi>natural evil</hi> when sanctified. The sanctifying takes not away all the <hi>natural evil;</hi> but by a less evil preventeth a greater. Death is not <hi>bonum naturale,</hi> because <hi>sanctified.</hi> Pain is pain still, <hi>&amp; malum vel disconveniens naturae,</hi> and <hi>punishment</hi> still: The <hi>good</hi> is <hi>accidental</hi> to the punishment, and therefore makes it nevertheless to be <hi>poena, vel malum per se,</hi> though at the same time it be by accident <hi>majus bonum.</hi> What is it that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally good? is it not <hi>malum poenae?</hi> If so, it remaineth <hi>malum poenae</hi> still, or else you cannot say that <hi>malum poenae</hi> is accidentally good. And when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61305:198"/> all is done, it is but an improper speech to say, that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> because they are <hi>accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> made the <hi>means</hi> of our good. The goodness is properly in their <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>accidental effect</hi> (and the Sanctifier) rather than in them: And therefore they are more properly said to be <hi>submitted</hi> to for the good that followeth them, than <hi>desired</hi> or <hi>loved:</hi> It is not <hi>Pain,</hi> or <hi>Death;</hi> but <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>God</hi> that I must <hi>love.</hi> Whereas, were they <hi>good</hi> indeed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they might be <hi>loved</hi> themselves.</p>
                        <p>I do leave out the far greatest part of the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my meaning on this subject, because I did it lately and largely on the Animadversions of another Learned Brother; and I am backward to repetitions, because it is most for my own informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I examine your Animadversions.</p>
                        <p>I will not contend with you about these phrases, but only I would advise you, that you take heed of arguing thus: That which works for our good is sanctified to us, and so is no more evil: But sin worketh to our good; therefore it is sanctified, and is no more evil, but good.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. An over seeing Answer. The <hi>Question</hi> is of sins interest as the <hi>efficient meritorious Cause:</hi> The <hi>Answer</hi> is of sin as the <hi>terminus amovendus,</hi> or <hi>privatio finis.</hi> We do not differ in that, Whether the <hi>curing of sin</hi> be the <hi>end of Chastisement?</hi> but where it is so, yet, Whether <hi>sin</hi> be not the <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cause,</hi> so far as it is <hi>evil?</hi> You might better have instanced in <hi>Chastisement,</hi> than <hi>medicining</hi> of Children. No wise Father chastiseth his Child, but his <hi>fault</hi> is the <hi>meritorious Cause,</hi> as well as the <hi>final (Reductivè)</hi> (his <hi>Reformation</hi> I mean.) You might therefore as truly have said, [There would be no Chastisement, if there were no <hi>sin meriting</hi> it,] as, [If there be no sin to be <hi>cured by</hi> it.] It is <hi>essential</hi> to <hi>Punishment</hi> (of which <hi>Chastisement</hi> is a <hi>species)</hi> that it be <hi>[for sin as the meritorious Cause, really or supposed.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Your other assigned Reasons therefore are no Reasons; for they belong to the <hi>final Cause,</hi> and not to the <hi>efficient.</hi> And you do but leave me to renew my Question, What reason can you give, why God should have attained all those good ends (our Tryal, Conformity, his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.) without</hi> our suffering, which now he attaineth by it, if <hi>sin</hi> were not the <hi>meritorious Cause?</hi> and <hi>some wrath</hi> still in it? specially, when God hath fully told us, that <hi>he afflicts not willingly:</hi> that <hi>man</hi> suffereth but <hi>for his sin; that for the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>is all this,</hi> &amp;c. and that he will not afflict his Creature without its
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61305:199"/> desert. If by <hi>[Conformity to Christ]</hi> you mean, not to his <hi>Holiness,</hi> but to his <hi>Suffering:</hi> I answer, That is <hi>no good</hi> to us of it self, but an <hi>evil:</hi> For it was the <hi>evil of Punishment</hi> that we deserved that he bore; and therefore if it be a good to be therein conformed to him, then it is good to bear God's Vindictive wrath. Indeed we may have comfort in our suffering, in that we suffer but what Christ hath suffered (in several respects that I need not stand on:) But the good is, that our Conformity in suffering, tends to make us conform in Holiness, and so in Glory, in our measure.</p>

                        <p>They are not <hi>fully opposite,</hi> nor inconsistent; else I should not think Chastisement is from both. But sure there is some opposition: Let their Objects be judg.

                        <p>I grant that the New-Covenant, promising Life on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Believing, may be said to threaten death only in case of final Unbelief; that is, except one continue in Unbelief unto the end, he shall not perish: 1. Yet when it is said, that <hi>Christ will come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi>
                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61305:203"/> 2 Thess. 1. 7, 8. I conceive, that by <hi>obeying the Gospel,</hi> is meant obeying the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> to which even the Gospel it self doth require obedience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. So that such as transgress the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> are liable to death, not only <hi>by the Law,</hi> but also by <hi>the Gospel,</hi> though the Gospel withal hold out pardon to those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, which the Law doth not. 2. Besides, few (I think) will deny, that the Old-Covenant is still of use to let us see what is due unto us for sin, and what need we have of Christ. But when it is said, that Believers are freed from the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; the meaning is, that they are not tied to those strict terms which are contained in that Covenant, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to obtain life upon condition of full and perfect obedience to the Law, or otherwise for any the least Transgression to incur eternal Damnation.</p>

                        <p>This is the great Point that so many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; wherein yet you agree with me. 1. It is not only an <hi>implicite</hi> Threatning (implied in the Promise) to Unbelievers; but an <hi>explicite.</hi> 2. I believe not, that by the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8. is meant <hi>directly</hi> the <hi>Moral Law, as such:</hi> But obedience to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is <hi>implied</hi> in it, so far as it is the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> to be <hi>sincerely</hi> obeyed, as a consequent of Faith, and implied in Faith. 3.

But yet thus far I may justly Apologize: 1. I did not mean it of Infants or Ideots, but only of the Aged and Rational. 2. I plainly speak of a real change only, as necessary to give title to the relative. And I do not see yet, but this is true of all, for all your two Exceptions. And first for Infants, I answered, 1. They have not the relations of <hi>[justified, adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church-member,</hi> &amp;c.] but upon a <hi>real change</hi> or work, to give them title: But that work is on the <hi>Parents</hi> (and not requisite in themselves) which gives title both to Parent and Child to the relative benefits. I said not, that <hi>[God never makes a relative change, where he makes not a real on the same person.</hi> 2. And for my judgment against Mr. <hi>Bedford:</hi> 1. I do shew my doubtfulness in that point: I have proved the <hi>relative</hi> change on Infants; when you have proved the <hi>real</hi> on them to be as <hi>common,</hi> then I will yield to you, and thank you. But you must be pleased to consider withal, how to resolve the difficulties on the other side; and answer both the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61305:206"/> Arguments of the Fathers, and Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Davenant,</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> &amp;c. which are brought to prove the efficacy of Baptism to its just end <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenti obicem,</hi> if you deny the ordinary relative change on Infants: or if you yield it, but withal maintain the certain concurrence of an infusion of Grace (as you speak) even into them that after pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; then be pleased to prove, that such true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification (for so you call it) may be lost (which seems to be against your judgment) and answer the rest of my Arguments against Mr. <hi>Bedford.</hi> It is easie enough to see inconveniences seeming to clog an Opinion: But we must withal consider the inconveniencies of the contrary Opinion. If you maintain, that the Child of a true Believer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God by Baptism, according to his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in Prayer and Faith by the Parents, doth not receive Remission of sin (certainly;) I think you must either say, that <hi>Remission is not an end of the Ordinance,</hi> and so it is not a Seal of Remission, or of the Remitting-Covenant of Grace (which is not true;) or else, that <hi>God's Ordinances may miss of their ends, without mans causing-fault;</hi> and that God's Covenant to his People and their Seed, may be broken; or else (encline to the Anabaptists, and say) that <hi>All the Seed of true Believers are not in the Covenant of Grace</hi> with God, nor should be baptized; and <hi>we know not which of them it is that are in Covenant:</hi> Or else devise another Covenant of Grace, containing only <hi>Church priviledges,</hi> and not <hi>Remission</hi> (which some call an <hi>external Covenant)</hi> as to the benefit promised; and say, that the Seed of Believers are only in this, and Baptism sealeth only to this: Which leaveth the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61305:207"/> in as hopeless a case as the Anabaptists leave them: which contradicteth Scripture, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth Baptism for higher ends, <hi>viz.</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins; and which hath given the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists that advantage to insult, by playing upon that new-devised Covenant; and even baffle us, when we cannot prove it from Scripture, and so doth much harden them, and encrease their number (as I know by experience of them.)</p>
                        <p>For the Text you cite, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. speaks expresly of the Aged; and I think so doth that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. The Word saith also, <hi>He that believeth not, shall be damned,</hi> and yet that is not extended to <hi>Infants.</hi> Besides, those Infants that have only <hi>Remission,</hi> and not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> will lose it (this may be said;) and therefore are not Christ's in that strict sence, as those that have <hi>both.</hi> If you say, What if they die in Infancy? Those of that judgment will answer you, That then (if the Parents were true Believers) it is a certain sign that they had the <hi>Spirit</hi> as well as Remission. So much of Infants.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And for your second Exception, I reply, 1. My speech fully shews, that I meant not <hi>all Relations,</hi> but only <hi>saving-Relations;</hi> as, <hi>Remission, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adoption,</hi> &amp;c. But yet I see no appearance of strength against it in your Argument, if I <hi>had</hi> meant so. For is there <hi>no real change</hi> in the members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church? Of <hi>Infants</hi> I have spoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And if there be none in the rest, then the Church differs little from the Pagan World, if they differ <hi>only in Relation;</hi> and then any man may be be baptized, whether he <hi>profess Repentance and Faith</hi> or not? Is the <hi>solemn Profession of believing in Christ,</hi> and <hi>repenting of all sin,</hi> and <hi>covenanting</hi> to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61305:207"/> forsake the World, Flesh and Devil, and to fight under Christ's Banner faithfully to the death, is this no Real change?</p>
                        <p>But I know you will say, It is not true Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                        <p>I reply, 1. Our Question is only of a <hi>real change,</hi> and not of <hi>true Sanctification.</hi> 2. As their <hi>real change</hi> is not true Sanctification, but <hi>Profession,</hi> or a <hi>common</hi> change; so their <hi>relative change</hi> is not <hi>true Justification,</hi> but to be annumerated to visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and partake of common Priviledges. Not because the Covenant of God doth contain no more, or that they enter any other Covenant; but because they perform not the conditions requisite to the participation of more, in that they do not sincerely accept the terms of the Covenant, and accordingly re-engage themselves to Christ.</p>

                        <p>You speak of a twofold Righteousness, requisite and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary unto Justification; but (so far as I can judg) this Doctrine is not founded upon Scripture. For that shews us, that Christ's Satisfaction merely is the Righteousness whereby we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though Faith be required on our part, that it may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us as ours, that so we may be justified by it. Faith is the condition whereby we are made partakers of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Satisfaction; and in that respect we are said to be justified by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. with <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. But that Faith is a distinct Righteousness, by which, together with Christ's Satisfaction, we must be justified, seems to be as if we should make the Medicine and the applying of it two things co-ordinate each with other, when as the one is but subordinate and subservient, as it were, to the other, to work the cure; the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61305:208"/> Medicine being to no purpose, except it be applied. It cannot, I think, properly be said, that we are cured partly by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and partly by the Application, but by the Medicine as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: So neither is it proper to say, that we are justified partly by Christ's Satisfaction, and partly by Faith, each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a distinct Righteousness whereby we are justified, but that we are justified by Christ's Satisfaction as our only Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in that respect; yet not by it simply considered; but as that whereby it is made ours, that we may be justified by it.</p>

                        <p>You come now a little nearer the quick; and therein seem very strongly to dissent from me: But when all is examined, it proves most but in words, while you grant in sense all, or most that I desire. Yet because this is a point of so great moment, and you think here lieth my <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, I think necessary to handle it more fully. And because you pass over (without taking notice of it) the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my sence of Righteousness, I must briefly repeat it.</p>
                        <p>It is not the <hi>particular Vertue</hi> called <hi>Justice,</hi> by which we give <hi>suum cui{que}</hi> distributively or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatively, which we now are handling. It is <hi>in sensu forensi</hi> that we speak of <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> And in that sense, Righteousness is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>causae vel personae.</hi> The <hi>persons Righteousness</hi> is joyned in the Righteousness of his <hi>Cause,</hi> and ever supporteth it. The <hi>Cause</hi> is sometime only <hi>one Action</hi> or <hi>Habit,</hi> or some <hi>few</hi> only; and then the <hi>person</hi> is justified but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> or as to <hi>that Action</hi> of which he was accused, and no further (by the Righteousness of that his <hi>Cause.)</hi> Sometime the Cause is <hi>all a mans Actions</hi> or <hi>Dispositions</hi> which are called in question, which he is put to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61305:208"/> And if he justifie <hi>all,</hi> he <hi>fully</hi> justifieth <hi>his person,</hi> which is called <hi>Justificatio personae</hi> in the most usual sense of that phrase. But yet a mans <hi>Cause</hi> may lye in other things than <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:</hi> (of which anon) and he may have other ways to be justified.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Righteousness</hi> in question is contrary to <hi>guilt. Guilt</hi> is twofold, 1. <hi>Reatus culpae.</hi> 2. <hi>Reatus poenae:</hi> The first so called, in reference to the <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Prohibition:</hi> The second, in reference directly to the <hi>Sanction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So is there a <hi>twofold Righteousness,</hi> and in either of them is considerable, both the <hi>form,</hi> and the <hi>quasi-materia.</hi> The <hi>Precept</hi> commandeth to do, or not do. He that <hi>obeyeth accordingly,</hi> is <hi>righteous,</hi> and not <hi>reus culpae.</hi> The <hi>Sanction</hi> containeth <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>Comminations,</hi> or determineth <hi>de praemiis &amp; poenis:</hi> He that is not <hi>obligatus ad poenam,</hi> is righteous in respect to the <hi>Commination;</hi> and he that hath <hi>jus ad praemium,</hi> is <hi>righteous</hi> as to the <hi>premiant act</hi> of the Law.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Justification</hi> supposeth <hi>Accusation;</hi> so <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> supposeth (in the <hi>Judicial</hi> sense of the word) a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Accusation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As the Law consisteth of these two parts (the <hi>preceptive (de agendo vel non agendo)</hi> and the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;)</hi> so there is a <hi>twofold Accusation</hi> that we are liable to: 1. That <hi>we have sinned,</hi> or have <hi>Reatum culpae.</hi> 2. And that we are therefore <hi>Obligati ad poenam,</hi> and have no title to the Reward. To be righteous, in respect of the <hi>former Accusation</hi> (if it be according to the Law of Works at least, that we are accused, or (as I think) the Law of Grace either) is to be <hi>Non-peccator,</hi> or to be <hi>Innocent.</hi> To
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61305:209"/> be righteous, in respect to the <hi>latter Accusation,</hi> is to be <hi>Non-obligatus ad poenam,</hi> or <hi>non-condemnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi> or <hi>to be rewarded,</hi> if the Accuser deny his title to the Reward: Or, if this last be questionable, whether <hi>[Just]</hi> signifie <hi>[Rewardable?]</hi> yet none can question the former, Whether it signifie <hi>[non obligatus ad poenam.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>formal</hi> nature of <hi>[Righteousness]</hi> therefore is <hi>relative:</hi> Even such a transcendental relation is it, as is <hi>Reatus,</hi> to which it is opposed; and as <hi>Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> is, which is the common formal nature of all proper <hi>Morality.</hi> And for the <hi>fundamentum</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> of this relation: The <hi>first subject</hi> of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> which is opposed to <hi>Reatus cupae,</hi> is <hi>Actio vel Actionis suspensio</hi> (under which is comprized the <hi>Disposition:)</hi> And <hi>from</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi> it resulteth to the <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> who is the <hi>last subject</hi> of it: The <hi>Person</hi> is therefore righteous (in this first sense) because his <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi> are righteous.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>subject</hi> of the <hi>latter sort</hi> of Righteousness (which is opposite to <hi>Reatus poenae)</hi> is <hi>only</hi> the <hi>person.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>immediate fundamentum</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, as it is <hi>personae,</hi> is the <hi>justitia actionum &amp; dispositionum,</hi> as being <hi>his own:</hi> And so it is a <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> founded in a <hi>relation,</hi> and <hi>both Moral.</hi>

                           <hi>in generis moris:</hi> And the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of this relation of <hi>Conformity,</hi> is immediately the <hi>proportio quantitativa vel perfectio adaequata actionum quoad regulam.</hi> So that the <hi>remote fundamentum</hi> of this <hi>Conformity,</hi> is the same with the <hi>subjectum,</hi> that is, the <hi>Actions themselves,</hi> or <hi>the Dispositions: Et ita remotè fundatur in actione &amp; qualitate:</hi> And the <hi>nearest fundamentum</hi> is that <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>number of actions,</hi> wherein consisteth that perfection which is the <hi>Adaequation</hi> to the Rule; and so it is founded <hi>in quantitate vel graduali perfectione.</hi> For this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> containeth, as it were, a conjunction of a twofold <hi>relation,</hi> that is, <hi>similitude (remotius)</hi> and <hi>equality (propius.)</hi> So much of that first Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which is a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Precept</hi> as <hi>Precept.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Where observe next, that this is none of our Righteousness, as I have proved, I think, in the Aphorisms: That we have <hi>no such Righteousness,</hi> as in <hi>our own Works,</hi> is beyond doubt among all good Christians. And that we have <hi>no such Righteousness of Christ</hi> (in this <hi>form,</hi> or as such) imputed to us strictly, and in it self, I perceive you and I are agreed.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61305:210"/> shew, that this overthroweth the main substance of the Gospel. I judg that God doth not for Christ's Righteousness esteem us to be <hi>non peccatores,</hi> but to be <hi>non condemnandos,</hi> and so to be <hi>quasi non peccatores quantum ad reatum poenae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is therefore the <hi>second kind</hi> of <hi>Righteousness (non Debitum</hi>

                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. The <hi>form</hi> of this Righteousness, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Law,</hi> nor the <hi>Title,</hi> nor any <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> which make up the <hi>Title;</hi> nor any <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> prerequisite to the Title: But only the <hi>[non debitum poenae,]</hi> to be <hi>[not guilty;] non obligatus ad poenam, [non condemnandus:]</hi> or, <hi>Jus ad impunita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem (quoad poenam damni &amp; sensus; jus ad vitam aeternam, per Christi justitiam promeritum &amp; gratis (sub conditione receptionis congruae) donatum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. <hi>Man's own Actions</hi> are not the <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum immediatum</hi> of his Righteousness: But the Constitution or tenor of the Law or Covenant is it. This will be thought strange by some perhaps, that <hi>Adam's perfect obedience</hi> did not <hi>immediately</hi> constitute him righteous, or <hi>non reum poenae;</hi> but that we should be <hi>made righteous</hi> by <hi>God's Law without us,</hi> more <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>immediately,</hi> than the <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of holiness within us, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61305:211"/> by us. But it is clear: For <hi>Righteousness</hi> (now in question) is but the <hi>debitum praemii,</hi> or <hi>non debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum poenae:</hi> And <hi>debitum</hi> is the <hi>immediate result</hi> or product of the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Gift,</hi> and not of our <hi>Actions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But you may object, <hi>At least our Acts are the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cause.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I answer, If by the <hi>matter,</hi> you mean the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> then they are not here: For here only the <hi>person</hi> is the subject righteous <hi>(non obligatus ad poenam:)</hi> But the matter of our Title-condition they may be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. In several senses therefore the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> and the <hi>Title</hi> may be called, <hi>[our Righteousness:]</hi> But so, as one be not taken for the other; 1. When we say, the <hi>Form</hi> is our <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> it is but an explicatory Proposition <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;</hi> for otherwise <hi>nihil praedicatur de seipso:</hi> The same thing is not the <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>predicate.</hi> 2. The <hi>Gospel-Donation</hi> or Constitution <hi>de non condemnando fideli,</hi> may be called <hi>our Righteousness fundamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> as being the <hi>direct efficient</hi> thereof: As the <hi>Law's Constitution de non condemnando perfectè obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienti,</hi> was the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 3. But most commonly we give the name to the <hi>conditio praestita,</hi> which is our <hi>Title</hi> secondary to Righteousness. Of which in particular we must speak more anon.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have given you my thoughts about the nature of Righteousness in general, and the first distribution of it from the two parts of the Law, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> and <hi>Sanction.</hi> Now I come to the second necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry distribution of it, which is from the two <hi>distinct Laws or Covenants;</hi> which is the thing that you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61305:212"/> deny: And here I will, 1. Prove, that <hi>there is a twofold Righteousness</hi> necessary in respect of the <hi>two Covenants.</hi> 2. And shew you the <hi>nature</hi> of them, and the <hi>difference</hi> between them. 3. The necessity hence of a <hi>twofold Justification;</hi> and in particular, of <hi>a Justification by Works.</hi> 4. I shall tell you of some Learned Divines that fully hold forth this Doctrine as I do. And,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That here are <hi>two distinct Righteousnesses</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, I shall prove now to you from these fix se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Mediums;</hi> which I think best, both for speed and strength, to lay all together. Where there are, 1. <hi>Distinct Laws,</hi> which our Righteousness must respect. 2. And <hi>distinct Legislators</hi> or <hi>Judges.</hi> 3. And <hi>distinct Accusations.</hi> 4. And <hi>distinct Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini proximi.</hi> 5. And <hi>distinct Termini remotiores.</hi> 6. And <hi>distinct Titles:</hi> there must needs be distinct Righteousnesses: But so it is in the present case; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet one of these alone will be a sufficient proof. And, 1. If there be <hi>distinct Laws</hi> from whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation we must be freed, and which require distinct <hi>conditions</hi> of that freedom, then there are <hi>distinct Righteousnesses:</hi> But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet here is a great difference (of which more anon.) The <hi>Law of Works</hi> doth not <hi>justifie</hi> us, nor cease to condemn us, because Christ satisfied not <hi>the Law properly,</hi> but the <hi>Lawgiver:</hi> For the Law knows no satisfaction strictly so called; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <hi>solutionem vel officii praecepti, vel poenae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatae (si ita dicam.)</hi> It was neither of these that Christ performed: For <hi>Actio Noxialis sequitur ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put.</hi> But yet Christ <hi>satisfied God as the Legislator of that Law,</hi> and so satisfied the <hi>ends</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi>
                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61305:212"/> so that though for all this Satisfaction, the <hi>Law</hi> condemns us still (as knowing no such thing as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; it being a <hi>supra-</hi>legal act to admit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which is <hi>redditio aequivalentis, loco ipsius dèbiti;)</hi> yet <hi>Deus ut judex secundum hanc legem,</hi> condemneth us not: The <hi>condemnatio legis,</hi> is but <hi>condemnatio virtualis &amp; impropria: Condemnatio enim strictissime sumpta, est sententia.</hi> It is therefore <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio judicis</hi> that is the full proper condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this we are freed from. Not <hi>ne sit,</hi> that it be not at all; for God sentenced man presently on the fall in part: But, 1. <hi>ne sit plena &amp; rigorosa,</hi> God did not <hi>fully</hi> then sentence according to the sence of the Law. 2. <hi>Ne sit executio vel plena, vel continuata:</hi> So that though it be <hi>ex post-facto,</hi> when the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is past, that Satisfaction is given, yet it is the ground of our Deliverance, and so that we are not <hi>plenè &amp; ad poenam perpetuam condemnandi per judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem propter violationem istius legis.</hi> The execution would have been full and continued, and that in rigor, if Satisfaction had not been made. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, though God had past Sentence on man for his sin at first, yet not on particular persons for all the sins of their lives, which are after committed against that <hi>Law:</hi> So that the <hi>Legislator</hi> will call <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on [Righteousness,]</hi> as attaining his Legal ends, though that <hi>Law</hi> it self will not: And the Law it self did necessitate it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And here is a <hi>distinct Legislator and Judg. Deus Creator</hi> makes the <hi>first Law,</hi> requiring perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and for want of it, beginneth Sentence and Execution, and admitteth of Satisfaction for the stay of it, and for our full deliverance from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred misery. Upon which <hi>Satisfaction received,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But most plain and undeniable it is, that we are liable in Judgment to <hi>distinct Accusations;</hi> not only <hi>circumstantially distinct</hi> (for I will not distribute <hi>à Circumstantiis)</hi> but even as to <hi>distinct Laws vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> or <hi>distinct kind of sins,</hi> and <hi>distinct Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> against us, and <hi>distinct penalties</hi> incurred, and distinct <hi>conditions</hi> unperformed (of which after.)</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We are liable to be accused as <hi>sinners</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and so as having <hi>broken the first Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deserved the <hi>penalty.</hi> This is a <hi>true Accusation,</hi> and against it <hi>directly</hi> there is <hi>no Justification.</hi> But against the <hi>annexed Accusation,</hi> that [therefore we are <hi>per judicem condemnandi ut obligati ad poenam]</hi> we must be justified, as by pleading the <hi>Dissolution of the Obligation per legem remediantem,</hi> as the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause;</hi> so by pleading <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> as the <hi>meritorious cause,</hi> and <hi>quasi materia</hi> of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; and as being a valuable consideration for the dissolving of our obligation to punishment.</p>
                        <p>But then we are liable to a <hi>second Accusation;</hi> viz. <hi>That we have no right in Christ, and the benefits of his Satisfaction:</hi> That <hi>we are not Believers,</hi> and that therefore <hi>we are guilty of that far sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Is not this Accusation <hi>toto Coelo</hi> different from the former? If <hi>this Accusation</hi> be true, the sinner must be condemned for want of <hi>title to Christ;</hi>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61305:214"/> and that on two grounds, 1. Because he is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered from the condemnation of the <hi>first Law.</hi> 2. Because he is found guilty by the tenor of the <hi>New-Law,</hi> both of the said <hi>non-liberation,</hi> and of the <hi>additional punishment.</hi> But if this Accusation be false, we are justified, as we next shew, by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Not guilty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, this <hi>Accusation</hi> may be threefold;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we are <hi>non-Credentes, not Believers</hi> at all, but Pagans.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Or that we are not <hi>sincerè Credentes,</hi> but <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and not <hi>true Believers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Or that we were <hi>solifidians,</hi> and added not <hi>sincere obedience</hi> to our <hi>Faith,</hi> and that to the end. Surely against these several Accusations, we must have several ways of Justification.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There are also several <hi>Termini</hi> or <hi>Sentences,</hi> from which by Justification they are to be freed; that is, both from being sentenced by <hi>God-Creator, as Legislator of the first Law;</hi> and from being sentenced by Christ the <hi>Redeemer, as Legislator of the New-Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>Termini remotiores</hi> also are distinct: One Condemnation which we must be justified against is, that <hi>Death</hi> threatned <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that by Justification must be prevented is, a far sorer punishment.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And lastly, there are several <hi>Titles</hi> or <hi>Pleas</hi> against these sentences. Do you think, if Satan ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you to be a final <hi>Ʋnbeliever,</hi> or an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that it will justifie you to plead, <hi>[Christ hath satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?]</hi> Or if he say, <hi>[Thou art a sinner,]</hi> is it enough to say, <hi>[I do believe?]</hi> No: But when he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>[Thou hast sinned, and therefore shouldest be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned according to the Law:]</hi> We must plead, <hi>[quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad</hi>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61305:215"/>
                           <hi>Meritum; Christ hath made Satisfaction, and the merit of that sufficeth, against the demerit of my sin;</hi> and, <hi>quoad legis constitutionem,</hi> the Obligation of the first Law is dissolved by the <hi>Grant</hi> of the latter. [So that Christ's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> as to the point of <hi>Merit,</hi> (which is the <hi>Aptitudo ad officium conditionis</hi> in the first Law) is <hi>loco conditionis à nobis praestitae:</hi> And so far is <hi>our Title.</hi> But then because it being not of our <hi>own performance,</hi> there must concur <hi>our actual interest,</hi> to make it to be <hi>formaliter Titulus</hi> to us; and this interest is by God conveyed by a <hi>New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> and this New-Law or Grant, is again <hi>conditional.</hi> Hence it followeth, that we are devolved over to the New-Law, before our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Deliverance from the Old is absolute and compleat: And so, though Christ's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be compleat, and <hi>perfecta satisfactio,</hi> and nothing be wanting <hi>quoad meritum;</hi> yet it is but <hi>Titulus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinalis, vel conditionalis;</hi> wanting nothing in it self, but something to <hi>appropriate</hi> it <hi>to us</hi> to apply it, and give us interest: And that is, 1. On God's part, his <note place="margin">If any had rather call Faith <hi>Conditio Tituli,</hi> than <hi>ipse Titulus,</hi> I do not dislike it, but think it the properest speech.</note> Grant or Promise. 2. On our part, the performance of the Condition of this New-Law or Promise. So that as to our Deliverance or Justification from the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first <hi>Law,</hi> we have a threefold Title ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to plead; or a Title thus divided: 1. <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad Meritum, Christ's Satisfaction</hi> is our <hi>only Title.</hi> 2. <hi>Quoad Appropriationem vel Applicationem:</hi> 1. God's gift, in Christ's Testament. 2. Our performing the Conditions (though the last be most imperfectly called Title.) As if <hi>Adam</hi> had perfectly obeyed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61305:215"/> there would have been in his Obedience: 1. The <hi>meritorious Value.</hi> 2. The <hi>personal Interest.</hi> So now <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> is imputed to us for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as to the <hi>Merit and Value.</hi> But the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> giveth the <hi>personal Interest:</hi> And because it gives it but <hi>conditionally,</hi> therefore <hi>our performance</hi> is of necessity to our <hi>personal Interest</hi> as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                        <p>But then here being a <hi>New-Law (Lex remedians)</hi> made for this <hi>Conveyance,</hi> here is occasion of a <hi>New-Accusation, New-Plea,</hi> and so a <hi>New-Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> and <hi>Justification:</hi> So that here is <hi>nova causa,</hi> and therefore must needs be <hi>nova justitia &amp; justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio.</hi> The Question was in the <hi>first cause, [Whether the Prisoner or accused be</hi> condemnandus <hi>as a sinner, for breaking the Law of Works?] Quoad meritum,</hi> it is presently determined for all: <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> was <hi>sufficiens pretium.</hi> But the case cannot be fully decided by that, for then the <hi>personal Interest</hi> is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned: Whereupon the cause is devolved to the <hi>New-Law,</hi> and the performance of its Condition. And there comes in the <hi>second cause: [Whether the Defendant have performed the Condition of the New-Law or Covenant?]</hi> And here the Condition hath not <hi>ad aptitudinem, rationem Meriti:</hi> Here he must be justified by producing his Faith in the Redeemer, which is the Condition: Which is the <hi>quasi-materia</hi> of that his Righteousness, and so his nearest Title to Justification. For if he be accused of <hi>final Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief or Rebellion,</hi> he must plead <hi>[Not guilty.]</hi> And here <hi>his Acts</hi> must <hi>first</hi> be justified, before <hi>he</hi> can be justified: Not that they must be justified <hi>against every Charge</hi> that can be brought against them, or as not being <hi>sinful,</hi> or as being a Conformity to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61305:216"/> Law of Works, or yet fully to the mere preceptive part of the New-Law: But as being the true <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of the <hi>Condition of the New-Law;</hi> which is the thing to be made good, when the Accusation is, that we have not performed that Condition.</p>
                        <p>Note, That where I said before, that this sort of Justification <hi>[to be non-obligatus ad poenam]</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth immediately to the man as the only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and not first to his actions: Yet I deny not, but his actions may be the conditional ground of it, as evil actions are the meritorious cause of guilt; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is improper to say, that the <hi>action</hi> is <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>obligatus ad poenam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For indeed it is another sort of <hi>justitia,</hi> another relation, which we are now speaking of, distinct from <hi>[non reus poenae:]</hi> I did not mention it before as a third sort of Righteousness constituted by the Law: 1. Because it is only conditional Laws that constitute it: And, 2. Not all those neither, because sometime a Condition may not be <hi>actio potestativa vel arbitraria;</hi> but it may be either something casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or some action or thing that is in anothers power. 3. And it is but <hi>subordinate,</hi> or a means to the last sort of Righteousness <hi>[non reatus poenae:]</hi> But yet indeed where Laws are (in their <hi>Sanction)</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, they cause a threefold guilt, or a threefold Righteousness: 1. <hi>Reatus culpae qua talis</hi> (by the <hi>Precept:)</hi> And so a <hi>Righteousness</hi> which is <hi>non Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus cupae.</hi> 2. <hi>Reatus non praestitae conditionis, quâ talis</hi> (by the act of Law which constituteth the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:)</hi> And so a <hi>Righteousness</hi> which consisteth in <hi>performing the Condition.</hi> 3. <hi>Reatus poenae proptes non praestitam conditionem</hi> (by the act of the Law instituting <hi>Poenam:)</hi> And so a Righteousness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61305:216"/> Now the last of these is only on the <hi>person for the action,</hi> and not <hi>on the action.</hi> But the two first, are both first on the <hi>action,</hi> and then on the <hi>person:</hi> Because <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>actions</hi> were <hi>conform</hi> to the <hi>Precept,</hi> and so <hi>just;</hi> therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was reputed <hi>conform</hi> to the <hi>Precept,</hi> and so <hi>just.</hi> Because <hi>Paul</hi> did perform the <hi>Conditions</hi> of the New-Covenant, his <hi>action</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and sincere Obedience was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that Covenant, so far as it instituted the Condition; and in that sense <hi>just:</hi> And if any had accused <hi>Paul</hi>'s actions as being <hi>no true performance</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the New-Law or Testament, <hi>they</hi> might first be justified from their own Justice, and then <hi>he</hi> consequently be in that point just by result therefrom, because the <hi>actions</hi> were his own, and so justified thereby against the Accusation of <hi>non-</hi>performance.</p>
                        <p>And this is it that we use to call the <hi>quasi-materia</hi> of our Righteousness; <hi>viz.</hi> that which is the <hi>subjectum primum</hi> of it, from whence it resulteth on our selves as the <hi>subjectum ultimatum,</hi> and there resteth. The <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, was the <hi>subjectum primum justitiae,</hi> from whence it flowed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s person as the ultimate principal subject. In reference to the mere Law of Works, we have <hi>no Righteousness strictly</hi> so called: But as to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator</hi> of that Law, and the <hi>sententia judicis,</hi> we have a <hi>Righteousness;</hi> and the <hi>subjectum primum</hi> of that is, <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> without us, which was equivalent to our Obedience or Punishment. And therefore we use to call Christ's Satisfaction, both the <hi>meritorious cause,</hi> and the <hi>matter</hi> of our Legal-Righteousness. So when the case is, <hi>Whether we are true performers of the Gospel-condition?</hi> there our

                           <hi>Performance it self</hi> must first be <hi>just</hi> (in that) and <hi>justified</hi> as the <hi>subjectum primum</hi> of our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And thence we our selves must by result be just, and so be justified by that as the <hi>quasi-materia</hi> of that Righteousness. So that the same Faith, which in our first cause is but <hi>Titulus ad justitiam Christi sanguine acquisitam</hi> (or rather only <hi>conditio Tituli;)</hi> is afterwards in the <hi>second</hi> cause, our <hi>ipsa justitia:</hi> For when it is <hi>ipse Titulus</hi> that is questioned, and so made the subject of the cause, then the <hi>firmness</hi> or <hi>solidity</hi> of that <hi>Title</hi> is also the <hi>ipsa justitia.</hi> For it is the <hi>justitia causae,</hi> and consequently must be <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially</hi> the <hi>justitia Personae:</hi> I say not his <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness universal,</hi> and in <hi>all respects;</hi> but his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <hi>so far,</hi> and <hi>as to that cause.</hi> Thus I have shewed you the necessity of a twofold Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: The proofs from particular Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are already in the Aphorisms, and more shall be said of it anon, if I find a call to it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now for the <hi>nature</hi> and difference of these Righteousnesses, though it be fully expressed in what is said already, yet I shall add these Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences more particularly, wherein the nature will be clearlier understood.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One Righteousness consisteth in <hi>[our non-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to punishment by the Law of Works, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our sinning against it;]</hi> because that <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is <hi>dissolved</hi> upon Satisfaction made by Christ. The <hi>other</hi> Righteousness consisteth in, <hi>[our non-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the far greater punishment, and also to the non-liberation from former misery,</hi> which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the New-Covenant.] This first difference is, from the different Laws or Covenants, which have different Conditions; and the fulfilling of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61305:217"/> Condition of each Covenant or Law, is that which is by that Covenant called the <hi>matter</hi> of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; as that from whence the Immunity from the Penalty doth result.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Herein I express the second difference, that it is from several punishments that we are freed from. And therefore it is not the same Righteousness to be <hi>non reus hujus poenae,</hi> and to be <hi>non reus alterius poenae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you say as some do, that the New-Law hath no proper penalty of its own.</p>
                        <p>I answer. 1. It is not so: For even already you acknowledge, that it hath a penalty <hi>gradually</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: And the extremest pain of the Stone is so gradually different from the least pain of that kind, that it may constitute a specifick difference in some sense.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But there are pains gradually different, due by the same Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer.</hi> But when it is due by a <hi>distinct Law,</hi> on <hi>distinct terms,</hi> there is requisite a <hi>distinct Plea</hi> for Absolution. 2. <hi>Non-liberation</hi> is the penalty threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the New-Law. He that believeth not, shall not be delivered from the Curse of the first Law. Here the <hi>same</hi> penalty <hi>materially,</hi> is the penalty of two distinct Laws, and <hi>formally</hi> two distinct pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, <hi>viz.</hi> of the first Law, as a penalty first due by it; and of the New-Law, as it is a <hi>non-libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> threatned by it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> This penalty we should have been liable to, had there been no New-Covenant.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Not <hi>formaliter:</hi> For it would have been but a Privation of the good of the first Covenant, but not a <hi>Privation</hi> (but mere Negation) of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61305:218"/>
                           <hi>Liberation purchased</hi> and <hi>offered,</hi> which is the good of the New-Covenant. For it cannot be a <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> till there be some <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>means</hi> of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it: And therefore to the Devils, the loss of God is <hi>Privatio;</hi> but their <hi>non-liberation</hi> from that misery and loss is no <hi>Privation:</hi> For they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had means or hopes to attain such a Liberation; <hi>e. g.</hi> If a hundred men lye in Prison for Murther, and fifty of them be put death without remedy: These die on the Law against Murther. But if the Parliament to the other fifty make a pardoning Act of Grace, saying, [All that will thankfully accept it, and come out of Prison, shall be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the rest shall die by double Torments:] Here now the additional Torment is for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful refusal of pardon, not for the first fault; and the first deserved death is for both: As it is <hi>such a death,</hi> it is the penalty of the Law against Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as it is a death inflicted after the offer of pardon (which did, as it were, conditionally give a new-life) so it is the penalty of the Law of Grace, which penalty hath in it more than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the loss or Privation of a <hi>New-life,</hi> and the <hi>non-liberation</hi> from the formerly-adjudged death. Thus it is in our present case so plainly, that I need not apply it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third Difference is this: Our first Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is without us, in the <hi>Merit and Satisfaction</hi> of another, Jesus Christ; and in his free gift by Covenant. But our <hi>second Righteousness</hi> is <hi>within us,</hi> and by us: For the New-Law giver will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a <hi>Mediator</hi> to <hi>believe, and repent, and obey Christ for us;</hi> nor of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our <hi>final Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Ʋnbelief.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61305:218"/> 4. Difference: The first Righteousness is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines said to be the same thing with <hi>Remission of sin;</hi> and in substance it is so. The <hi>second Righteousness</hi> is so far from it, that (as to the point in question) it consisteth in <hi>Innocency,</hi> or <hi>Not-guiltiness,</hi> that is, of the <hi>non-performance</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of the New-Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>first</hi> Righteousness is opposite to that guilt which sin in general procureth. The second is opposite only to that guilt which is procured by <hi>one kind of sin</hi> in <hi>special, viz.</hi> Rejecting finally the Lord that bought us.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>first</hi> Righteousness, as it is materially in Christ's Satisfaction, is not the <hi>Idem</hi> which the Law required, but the <hi>Tantundem.</hi> The second is the <hi>same</hi> which is required by the <hi>New-Law,</hi> as its <hi>Condition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. The <hi>first</hi> Righteousness, as it is materially in Christ's Satisfaction, is not so denominated by the Law it self (which required the <hi>Idem,</hi> and not the <hi>Tantundem, aut obedientiam aut poenam delinquentis, &amp; non poenam innocentis;</hi> but by the <hi>Legislator</hi> who is above Law. The second Righteousness is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law of Grace it self, as it requireth it as a Condition.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The first Righteousness is, that we may be justified <hi>à condemnatione Legis,</hi> by <hi>dissolving</hi> its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation already contracted. The second is, that we may <hi>prevent condemnationem Legis novae,</hi> and may <hi>not contract</hi> the guilt.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The <hi>first</hi> Righteousness seemeth to justifie us against a <hi>true Accusation, [That we by sin deserved death.]</hi> The second serveth to justifie us only against a <hi>false Accusation, [That we have not</hi>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61305:219"/>
                           <hi>performed the Condition of the New-Covenant,</hi> that is, that we have finally rejected Christ.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The Righteousness of the first Covenant, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Covenant, lyeth in so full <hi>Perfection of duty,</hi> that the performance is honorable to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and would have made the reward to be of <hi>Debt:</hi> And as it is in Christ's Satisfaction, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly yet <hi>more</hi> honorable to the <hi>Satisfier.</hi> But the <hi>second</hi> Righteousness (the performance of the Condition of the New-Covenant) is purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to another use, to be the sinners <hi>self-denying</hi> acknowledgment of his sin and misery, and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to deliver himself, and so to put all the honor from himself of his recovery, and to honor the Free-Grace of the Redeemer. So that it is not <hi>Merit</hi> that is its <hi>Aptitudo ad officium conditionis,</hi> but the glorifying of him that hath merited for us.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The matter of the first Righteousness is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with sin in the Performer; because the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> and the <hi>Condition</hi> are of <hi>equal extent:</hi> The <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obeying</hi> of the Precept, is the <hi>Condition.</hi> But the Righteousness of the <hi>second</hi> Law, may, and doth consist with <hi>sin</hi> against the <hi>Precept</hi> of that same <hi>Law,</hi> because the <hi>Condition</hi> is not of so large extent as the <hi>Duty commanded.</hi> Christ <hi>commandeth</hi> us much more than he hath directly made the <hi>Conditions</hi> of his Covenant. Indeed <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> to him is part of his Condition; and so the Precept of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect duty, is the Rule according to which sincere Obedience doth labour to square its actions: And so the <hi>particular duties</hi> may be said <hi>materially</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Condition:</hi> But it is but <hi>remotely,</hi> so far as they are necessarily the matter of <hi>sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> For many a duty may be omitted, and yet Obedience be sincere.</p>

                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61305:219"/> 12. Chiefly observe, that the first Righteousness is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>justitia universalis,</hi> where it is performed by the person himself: And it is <hi>universalis exceptâ vel salvâ conditionis necessitate,</hi> when it is performed by <hi>another (by Christ)</hi> and so given us. But the <hi>second Righteousness,</hi> consisting in our performance of the New-Covenants Condition, is but <hi>justitia particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris vel secundum quid,</hi> as to <hi>this particular cause.</hi> I say, that the first had been <hi>justitia universalis,</hi> if performed by our selves <hi>(vel naturaliter vel civiliter ut per delegatum nostrum:)</hi> For then we had been <hi>absolutely and perfectly innocent.</hi> But being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>another (aequivalenter in Satisfactione)</hi> and one that was not our Delegate, but a free Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, therefore it was none of ours upon the mere performance; and therefore the Performer and the Accepter did themselves choose on what terms it should be applied to us, or be made ours <hi>quoad fructus:</hi> And the terms resolved on were the New-Covenants Conditions, which are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to our participation hereof. So that now Christ's Satisfaction is not <hi>simpliciter</hi> our <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Righteousness;</hi> for then there were no need of any other of any sort, to any end, no not the Inherent Righteousness, as commonly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But it is our <hi>universal Righteousness,</hi> except only as to performance of the Condition of its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: For Christ never died for the <hi>final non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance</hi> of this: And where it is performed (as it is by all that are sacred) he need no more to die for their <hi>non-performance,</hi> than for any nomnial, or falsly-charged sin, which is no sin, but a duty. In all conditional Grants, the Condition is excepted from the Grant. <hi>Quod est in conditione non est in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatione.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61305:220"/>
                        <p> Further, where I call the second, <hi>[a particular Righteousness,]</hi> understand, that there is a <hi>twofold particular Righteousness,</hi> according to the cause. One when the cause is of small moment to the plenary Justification and Liberation of the accused: So any Reprobate, or the Devil himself, may be falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and may be righteous as to the matter that he is accused of (as <hi>Bradshaw</hi> truly observes.) But the other is, when the cause is of so great moment, that the Justification or Condemnation, the Life or Death of the party depends upon it, as being the very Condition of that Act of Grace, or remedying Law which all our hope is in, and by which we must be judged: This is our last.</p>
                        <p>And here I must either explain or reverse my speech in <hi>Aphoris.</hi> p. 203. <hi>[Because there is no danger to us from false Accusation before the All-knowing God, therefore Scripture saith nothing of any such Justification.]</hi> Indeed we are in no danger of this or any Accusation (those that are in Christ:) But it is evident in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the Judgment-process, that the main point that will be in question and tryal will be, <hi>Whether we were true Believers or Performers of the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, or not?</hi> and so, <hi>Whether we have that personal Inherent Righteousness, which is the Condition of our interest in Christ and his benefits.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Accuser</hi> hath no hope in any other Plea against any man, but that he is an <hi>Ʋnbeliever,</hi> or Rejecter of recovering mercy. He is not so ignorant of Scripture, as to think to prevail for mens Condemnation, merely because they are <hi>sinners,</hi> when he knows they will plead, that <hi>Christ hath satisfied.</hi> But he will labour to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61305:220"/> prove, that <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> shall <hi>not absolve</hi> them, because they have <hi>no right in him,</hi> as having <hi>not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Conditions</hi> for participation. On this the sinner must stand or fall, and the final Sentence pass.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The last Difference also especially to be noted is, That the <hi>first Righteousness</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as being the Creatures <hi>Perfection</hi> justly required by the holy sin-hating Creator. But the second Righteousness (personal) is required <hi>propter aliud,</hi> in subordination to the first, as a means to its end: And so stands in no opposition to it, nor doth it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it of any imperfection; no more than the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a means doth signifie any imperfection in the end. The whole reason and nature of Merit ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the first Righteousness: But because it was not of our performance, and because the Redeemer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to make us lawless or masterless, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a New-Covenant or Law was requisite both for application, donation, or conveyance of <hi>Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> to us; and also to prescribe us our <hi>duty</hi> which should be necessary thereto: And so comes in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the 2d Righteousness, subordinate to the first</p>
                        <p>Thus I have shewed you the differences of these two Righteousnesses. And though some of them are indeed the same in sense with others, yet if the variety of Notions do but conduce to the clearer Explication of the real differences, I have my end. The difference of the two Laws or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, is the main ground which shews the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this twofold Righteousness.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

To be <hi>accused as a sinner,</hi> that is, [one that <hi>did not continue in all things written in the Law to do them,]</hi> is not the same as to be <hi>accused</hi> to be <hi>[an Ʋnbeliever or Rejecter of Christ,</hi> or one that would not have him reign over us, or one that neglected so great Salvation, and improved not the Talents of the Redeemer's Mercies, or obeyed not the Gospel, or trod under foot the blood of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Must you not be justified against the former Accusation by <hi>Christ's blood directly?</hi> and against the latter by your <hi>own Innocency?</hi> Will it serve to justifie any man, when Satan accuseth him of <hi>final Ʋnbelief</hi> or <hi>Impenitency,</hi> to plead <hi>Christ's Satisfaction?</hi> Methinks this case is so plain, that I must desire your pardon that I have used so many words about it.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Your Assertion, That it's without Scripture, is but a <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> and your proof none at all. You shall see the contrary fully anon, and did see Scripture enough cited in the <hi>Aphorism.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. If Faith be the Condition constituted by a New-Law or Covenant, by which we are to be judged to life or death, then the performance of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61305:223"/> that Condition is the thing materially by which that same Covenant will judg us righteous, <hi>non reos poenae illius Legis:</hi> And so when the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether we have performed that Condition or no? the actual performance is our Righteousness as to that cause.

                        <p n="6">6. If it were <hi>improper</hi> to say, <hi>We are healed by the Medicine, and by the Application:</hi> 1. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech deceives us. 2. Rules of Logick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. 3. Scripture should speak improperly in saying, We are justified by Faith and Works, and not only by Christ's Satisfaction. 7. The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Medicine hath its interest in the Cure, <hi>ex necessitate &amp; aptitudine naturali</hi> immediately: But Faith, Repentance and sincere Obedience, have their interest in our Justification; but remotely <hi>ex naturali aptitudine,</hi> and immediately <hi>proximè ex Constitutione Divina,</hi> and in their <hi>Moral</hi> respect.

                           <hi>which partly one, partly the other justifie, when one is subordinate,</hi> &amp;c.] What have I said so frequently and fully, as that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>no part</hi> of our <hi>Legal Righteousness?</hi> That it is not joyned with Christ's Satisfaction to make up our Righteousness? nor is one grain of it? nor hath any Merit in it? or is accepted for its value? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I fully profess that they are <hi>not co-ordinate;</hi> but that the very <hi>New-Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> is but <hi>subordinate</hi> to the <hi>Old;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Righteousness</hi> required by it, is but <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> and <hi>subservient</hi> to the Righteousness of Christ's Satisfaction for our sins against the Law; and that it is the <hi>Condition</hi> of enjoying it: And therefore <hi>our Righteousness so far, because a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on instituted by a New-Law.</hi> It is injurious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to talk of <hi>Co-ordination</hi> as my sense, who so constantly profess the one to be <hi>subservient, &amp; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aliud,</hi> as your Application of the Medicine is. And I little doubt, but it is proper to say, He that hath the Medicine, and will not apply it, dies for want of Application; and he that doth apply it, recovers in one respect, through the Medicine; in another, because he applied it. I think we are agreed, how much of the praise belongs to the Medicine, and how much to the Application: And then for the <hi>term [Righteousness,]</hi> we shall see what the Scripture saith of it anon, when your Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more necessarily lead me to it.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. But you must further remember, that this <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>[Righteous,]</hi> in the sense of the Law of Works, <hi>fundatur non solum in Qualitate, sed &amp; in Quantitate: Et relata quorum fundamentum est quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titas non recipiunt magis &amp; minus, inquit Alsted.

                        <p>If therefore our Question be but of <hi>one action,</hi> that action is not <hi>strictly Conform</hi> to the <hi>Law of Works</hi> (the Precept) which is not <hi>perfectly Conform:</hi> But when we speak not of <hi>one action,</hi> but of the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of the person which is denominated from <hi>all his actions</hi> together, I thought the case had then been unquestionable, That there is none righteous,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61305:228"/> no not one. Do you indeed hold, that a sinner is truly righteous according to the Law of Works? If he be: 1. It is either with that Righteousness which is a Conformity to the <hi>Precept</hi> as <hi>Precept,</hi> and is opposite to <hi>Reatus culpae:</hi> (But that is utterly untrue, because though the actions admit of <hi>magis &amp; minus;</hi> yet <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>relative Equality</hi> do not, but stand <hi>in centro.</hi> And it is a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which that Law will call a Conformity, and doth expresly require.) 2. Or it is with that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is in the performing of the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and is opposed to <hi>Reatus non praestitae conditionis:</hi> (But that's as untrue; for in that Law, the <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> are both of an extent: The Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only <hi>perfect Obedience.)</hi> 3. Or it is with that Righteousness which consisteth in <hi>non-dueness of Punishment,</hi> and is opposite to <hi>Reatus poenae:</hi> (But if that were but materially in imperfect works, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of that Law, then Christ died in vain: And it is the person, and not the actions, that is the subject of that.)</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You say, <hi>[Qualification and Conformity] is the same.</hi> Even as <hi>Albedo</hi> and <hi>Similitudo,</hi> or as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum &amp; Accidens,</hi> or as <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> are the same.</p>
                        <p>You ask, <hi>[What is the Qualification which makes it holy, but the Rectitude and Conformity to the Rule, which makes it righteous?]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I reply, 1. If you take Holiness (as now we do) for a <hi>Quality,</hi> then no relation doth constitute it certainly. But that Quality may be part of the matter or subject of the relation. 2. It's true, that <hi>the Subjectum primum,</hi> or the <hi>materia</hi> of our <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> (now pleaded for) is the Conformity of our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61305:229"/> actions and dispositions to the Rule. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (you well know) is, To what Rule? And I say, 1. Not to the Law of Works. 2. Not to the Precept of the Gospel as such, in its fulness. 3. But to the <hi>New-covenant,</hi> as instituting the <hi>Condition</hi> of our participation of Christ. Our <hi>Holiness</hi> is the <hi>matter</hi> (as it is sincere, not as in this or that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree) as it consisteth in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>sincere Obedience,</hi> which is conform to the <hi>New-Law quoad Conditionem;</hi> but it is not the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it self, much less is it the Righteousness of the person, that is <hi>formaliter</hi> the <hi>non-Reatus poenae Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis novae:</hi> Least of all is it a Conformity to the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> perfect or imperfect (for such there is none.)

Only I must still desire you to know, that by <hi>[Evangelical personal Righteousness,]</hi> I mean, not <hi>Holiness</hi> in that sense; but I mean, <hi>formaliter</hi> our <hi>non-Reatus poenae Evangelicae: Et fundamentaliter,</hi> 1. Our <hi>Conformity</hi> to that Law, as requiring the <hi>Condition only:</hi> And, 2.

                        </p>
                        <p>But because you so verily think, that the Law of Works doth call all Saints <hi>truly righteous,</hi> though <hi>imperfectly,</hi> I desire you to tell me these things: 1. Doth not Christ justifie the unrighteous, as to Legal Righteousness? How then do you prove them righteous according to that Law? 2. If the Law of Works call them truly righteous, then it will justifie them: For it cannot but justifie the just.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61305:229"/> 3. Doth not <hi>James</hi> say, he that offendeth in one, is guilty of all? How then can that Law know such a thing as imperfect Righteousness? 4. Doth not God say, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>He that saith to the wicked, [Thou art righteous] Nations shall curse him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he that justifieth the wicked, and condemneth the righteous, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi> But if the Law pronounce an imperfect Obeyer righteous, and yet condemn him to Hell, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the righteous. 5. May not the damned and Devils be pronounced righteous by the Law of Works in your sense? If any degree of (or rather towards) Conformity, give that title? And so also of all that perish. For they do somewhat, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, which the Law requireth: For I hope you will not say as the Pharisees, that the person is <hi>righteous,</hi> if <hi>most</hi> of his actions were <hi>good;</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi> when most are bad, as <hi>Paulus Burgens.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them <hi>(Addit. in Lyram in Jacob.</hi> against <hi>Rab.

                        <p>I think we differ not in this in sense. But, 1. I speak here (and most usually) not of the Covenant as it is accepted by man, and so is mutual: But as it is propounded and enacted by God, and offered, and so is the same with the New-Law, consisting of Precept and Sanction. 2. So that here I included that Mercy, which in order to the special blessings of the Covenant, the Mediator of the Covenant doth offer and give to men. And so, 1. The very <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> it self is a mercy to wicked men, however their abuse or rejection may make it their ruine. The matter of it containeth unspeakable mercies, even Pardon and Salvation; and for the extent of it, it is universal, and excludeth none: Though the <hi>Promulgation</hi> extend not to all, the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of the Covenant or Promise in it self doth. All have there a conditional Pardon and Grant of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation freely given them under the hand of God: And though their unbelief deprive them of the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enjoyment, yet the Grant (conditional) is even to the wicked an unspeakable mercy; or else the rejecting of it would not be so great a sin, nor so torment them for ever. 2. And there are other benefits subservient and additional, which the worst may receive. As to live among the godly, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61305:232"/> have their teaching, and examples, and prayers; to have the preaching of the Word, to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal common mercies, leading to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. These are not given merely to Believers, or on Condition of Faith. 3. The like may be said of those great mercies which are the foundation of the New-Covenant; <hi>viz.</hi> The Death of Christ, which was a Satisfaction sufficient for the sins of the whole World, and in some sort was made for all. 4. Yet I agree with you fully (and often so expressed my self) that Unbelievers are under the Curse of the Law, and unpardoned, and without right to Salvation.</p>

In point of <hi>Satisfaction, Merit</hi> or <hi>Value, Acceptance,</hi> i. e. <hi>Faith;</hi> is no part of our Righteousness.

                        <p n="2">2. If you speak of Conformity to the Rule of <hi>Precept</hi> as such, the same Answer serves: It may be conform <hi>in pluribus vel paucioribus partibus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriae,</hi> but those are formaliter <hi>conformitates discretae.</hi> But yet though <hi>de posse</hi> I say, <hi>[it may be] de facto.]</hi> I say, in our case it <hi>is not</hi> so: For the Act is not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible into parts conform,</hi> and <hi>parts inconform;</hi> and no man ever performeth one act fully and exactly conform to the Law of Works, or (I think) to the preceptive part of Christ's Law as such. But if this were otherwise, it were nothing to our business: For this is not <hi>our Righteousness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But (as I have told you) our Righteousness is <hi>formaliter non reatus poenae;</hi> And is there any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that? Every man is <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not-guilty.</hi>
                           <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61305:235"/>
                           <hi>Guilty</hi> is varied, both as to the several causes or parts thereof, and the several degrees of penalty due: But when the cause is one, and it is one penalty that we are accused to be liable to, we can be but <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilty;</hi> and if we are not so, we are <hi>Guilty.</hi> 2. This <hi>Not-guiltiness,</hi> as it respecteth the penalty of the Law of Works, is <hi>fundamentaliter</hi> from the gift of the Law of Grace. And there is here no degrees, either Christ and his Righteousness is imputed and given to us, or not; but not with a <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minus.</hi> 3. This Righteousness is <hi>materialiter</hi> in <hi>Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;</hi> and that also is not varied, though he might have satisfied for some sins or persons only, yet he hath done it fully: And between satisfying and not-satisfying, there is no mean; nor is this the Righteousness now in question.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This Righteousness is <hi>conditionaliter</hi> in <hi>our Faith;</hi> or rather, <hi>our Faith</hi> is the <hi>Condition</hi> of it. And this admits not of degrees: For it is the <hi>least degree</hi> of <hi>sincere Faith</hi> that is the <hi>Condition;</hi> and the highest degree is no more, nor will justifie more. The strongest Believer doth believe more than the weakest; but doth not more <hi>perform the Condition of Justification.</hi> For it is the verity of that Faith, which the Gospel hath made the Condition, which is our sincerity; and this is convertible with the Entity.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And for the Righteousness which is opposed to <hi>Reatus poenae novae Legis,</hi> it is a relation founded in another relation (Conformity;) and that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is not to the Precept as such, but to the Law as requiring the Condition (which great Divines call the specifick form of the Covenant or Law;) and this Condition is our Righteousness in the sense ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and admits not of degrees as a Condition, as is last said.</p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61305:236"/>
                        <p> Though if you go yet further from the form, and consider our Gospel-Righteousness neither <hi>in esse non Reatus poenae,</hi> nor <hi>in esse relativo Conformitatis ad Legem conditionem instituentem,</hi> nor <hi>in esse reali Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis-praestitae,</hi> but <hi>in esse Officii,</hi> as related to, or measured by the <hi>Precept,</hi> and that only <hi>quoad mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam Praeceptam;</hi> so I confess that our Faith and Holiness admit of degrees. And I think this Answer is plain, and the distinction necessary, and not vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nice.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And where you still say, that Holiness and Righteousness is all one; I have told you (I think sufficiently) a wide difference. If you take Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for passive Dedication to God, or the Relation of a thing consecrated or separated to God; so I told you it is indeed a <hi>Relation,</hi> but not the same with <hi>Righteous:</hi> If you take it for the <hi>Quality</hi> of our new-spiritual life; or the Habits of Grace, so it is <hi>materially</hi> the same thing with part of our Evangelical Righteousness in question, but not <hi>formally;</hi> nay, nor <hi>materially,</hi> as it is considered in any high degree, but merely as <hi>Sincere.</hi> If you consider it as those <hi>actions</hi> which are <hi>commanded,</hi> it is <hi>materially another</hi> part of our Righteousness: For it is the same act which the Law makes a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which it also makes to be <hi>Officium;</hi> and it is <hi>first Officium</hi> in order of nature, and then <hi>Conditio.</hi> But there is more made <hi>Officium,</hi> than is made the <hi>Condition</hi> properly and <hi>per se.</hi> But you after seem to take <hi>[Holiness] formaliter</hi> in a sense yet differing from all these, that is, as it is the <hi>Conformity</hi> perfect or imperfect) of <hi>Habits</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> to the <hi>Rule:</hi> The same with <hi>bonum Morale,</hi> as opposite to <hi>sin.</hi> And so it seems to me, you make all the <hi>good actions</hi>
                           <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61305:236"/> of the <hi>Heathens holy:</hi> for you think, that an <hi>exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> is not the only <hi>true Conformity.</hi> But in this sense (if it be <hi>good)</hi> Holiness and Righteousness much differ: It is indeed the same with that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is opposed to <hi>Reatus culpae;</hi> (if any man were found that had any such Righteousness according to the Law of Works, when indeed the best are but less unrighteous.) But it is not the same with <hi>[performance of the Condition] formally;</hi> much less the same formally with our <hi>non-Reatus poenae.</hi> Holiness in your sense as <hi>bonum,</hi> is denominated from its congruency to the <hi>Precept</hi> as a <hi>Precept:</hi> But I hope you will acknowledg a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those two Acts of the New-Law, <hi>instituere Officium,</hi> and <hi>instituere Conditionem;</hi> between; <hi>[Do this,]</hi> simply taken; and, <hi>[Do this, and live.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Your Charge (of my placing Righteousness only in <hi>Acts,</hi> and Holiness in <hi>Habits)</hi> is utterly against my oft express words. I say of Righteousness, <hi>p.</hi> 132. that <hi>[it is the relative consideration of these Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c.] p. 134. that <hi>[it may be materially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Holiness,]</hi> and divers the like. Yet let me tell you, that (though the Precept do require <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> whatsoever <hi>L. V.</hi> in <hi>Crellio Refutato</hi> say to the contrary, yet) he that should maintain against you, that it is not <hi>habitual Faith,</hi> but <hi>actual,</hi> which is properly <hi>&amp; in se,</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant, would put you hard to it; and perhaps not cross your own, or the common Principles; though I am not now of that opinion which excludes the Habit.</p>

                        <p>Sincerity is such perfection as doth consist with imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For one is more or less sincere, as more or less free from admixtures of Hypocrisie, and so more or less perfect. Neither can you (I think) evade by your distinction which you add immediately after; <hi>viz.</hi> That sincere Faith as such, is only materially our Righteousness and Perfection; but formally, as it's relatively our Conformity to the said Rule. For (so far as I can yet discern) Conformity to a Rule doth not consist in such an indivisible point, but that there may be degrees of it: So that one may be more or less (personally) righteous, as well as more or less holy. And so much may be understood by that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Let him that is righteous, be righteous still; and let him that is holy, be holy still; i. e.</hi> Let him not only continue righteous and holy, but also labour to be more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and holy: And doth not the Apostle require of those that are righteous and holy, that they be <hi>renewed in the spirit of their mind, and put on the new-man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness?</hi> Ephes. 4. 23, 24.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. I doubt not but <hi>sincerity of Righteousness</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth with <hi>imperfection of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> or of the <hi>matter</hi> of that <note place="margin">All this is but a strife about the word <hi>[Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.]</hi> And I repent that I used the word, because most may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake it, and it may do harm.</note> Righteousness. Sincerity is taken by Divines: 1. For a <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> (or if you will, a spiritual Grace.) 2. For the <hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi> of that Grace which we have. And thus they doubly use the word <hi>[Hypocrisie:]</hi> 1. For that Vice, which makes a man desire and endeavour to seem better than he is. 2. For a seeming or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing better than we are, or to do what we do not, though without affectation or dissimulation: For the falsity of that seeming-sincerity as a Vertue, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the first kind of Hypocrisie, <hi>viz.</hi> as a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vice; and thus you seem to take it: And so no
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61305:238"/> doubt but <hi>Sincerity</hi> may be more or less, as it hath less or more <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> mixt with it. If you take it in the second sense, so <hi>Sincerity</hi> is no <hi>particular Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> (nor the opposite <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> any <hi>particular Vice)</hi> but the <hi>Metaphysical Truth</hi> of our <hi>Vertues,</hi> which is nothing really distinct from them. But thus it is not very proper to speak of the <hi>admixture of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, q. d.</hi> a mixture of Verity and Falsity, Entity and <hi>non-</hi>Entity. But let that pass.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>last Sincerity</hi> is, 1. Either the <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> in its <hi>Physical</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: (And so the Acts or Habits may be encreased, but the Metaphysical Truth of each particular or degree is still a Concomitant <hi>modus</hi> of the Being, not capable of Intension or Remission in it self immediately, but as the Entity is intended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.) 2. Or it is the truth of their Vertuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Goodness-Moral, which is their Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as they are suited with the Precept, <hi>[Do this:]</hi> And so neither the Sincerity, nor the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Conformity have <hi>formaliter</hi> any Degrees; but <hi>materialiter vel subjectivè</hi> (they may, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be, so spoke of, because <hi>vel plures, vel pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciores materiae partes sunt conformes regulae:)</hi> But in our case, as to the Divine Rule, I have told you before, how inconform we are, and all our actions. But yet this is not the Sincerity that I speak of. 3. Sincerity therefore is taken here by me, for the <hi>Metaphysical Truth of our performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant.</hi> And therefore I said, <hi>[It is our Conformity to the Rule;</hi> viz. <hi>the Covenant as a Covenant,]</hi> to distinguish it from Conformity to the <hi>preceptive</hi> part as such. This is the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of our Graces or Duties, not <hi>Physically,</hi> as Habits or Acts
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61305:238"/> (that is presupposed) not <hi>morally, quoad praeceptum</hi> only, as vertuous or good: 4. But <hi>savingly, quoad conditiónem:</hi> As I have more fully opened to you in <hi>Cbap.</hi> 11. of my <hi>Treat. of Rest, Edit.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I must refer you for a fuller Explication of my sense of this. Now in this sense Sincerity admits of <hi>no degrees;</hi> for there is no <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>non-ens:</hi> And this Sincerity is but the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Verity of that Faith (whether in kind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree differing from other Faith, is nothing to this Controversie) which the Covenant hath made its Condition. Every man is either a sincere, that is, true performer of that Condition, or he is not; and no man is more truly a performer of it than other.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I have therefore over and over shewed you, that Conformity to the <hi>Rule of the Condition</hi> doth consist in such an <hi>indivisible punctum,</hi> that though one may <hi>praest are conditionem fortiùs &amp; alacriùs</hi> than another, yet none doth more truly perform it, or is more a performer of it, and consequently not more righteous in that sense. As our Divines use to say, A weak hand may as truly receive a Pearl, as a strong; and a weak Faith as truly receive Christ. If a Pearl be given to ten men, on condition they take it; he that takes it feebly, hath as good right to it, as he that grasps it hard: And if their right be called in Question, it will prove that the <hi>Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> or <hi>Conditio</hi> was not strong apprehending, but <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p n="3">3. I see not what the two Texts cited make against this: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. either speaks not of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> of Righteousness, but <hi>perseverance</hi> (and yet it may of Holiness; for you know it is usual to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the sense of the same Adjunct or Precept, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of subjects:) Or, 2.

                           <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23, 24. 1.

The like I yield of his Philanthropy, if that be called <hi>[Accepting our persons.]</hi> 3. But if you mean (as doubtless you do) the accepting our persons as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and reconciled to him, and so the lawful Objects of his special Love, I deny your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertion; and I affirm, That the <hi>Act and Habit of Faith</hi> are <hi>accepted of God,</hi> in <hi>order of Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>our persons</hi> are so <hi>accepted:</hi> 1. For Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of that <hi>Acceptance</hi> of our persons; and I know, I need not prove to you, that the <hi>Condition</hi> and its Acceptance, go before the benefit given on that Condition. The <hi>Acceptance of our persons,</hi> is the same as <hi>Reconciliation, Justification, Adoption</hi> in effect: For it is God's accepting us, as reconciled, justified, adopted ones. And is not the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> yea, and Knowledg, Repentance, before these?

I yield that there is such a preparation to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance made in the Satisfaction of Christ, as paid to God and accepted, that (the great impediments being removed) all men may be said, to be conditionally accepted before they believe: God is so far recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Mankind in general, that he treats with them on new-terms, and offers them actual Peace and Acceptance on very reasonable Conditions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the freeness of his gift.</p>

The general effect of Christ's Death, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so far, as to procure Acceptance of our <hi>Faith,</hi> (in order of nature, but not of time) before the Acceptance of our <hi>persons,</hi> by special Reconciliation.

                        <p n="1">1. I must first tell you, that I do recant these words, and the following Reasons of them, as all weak. I think it not improper to say, <hi>God in judgment will justifie our Faith from the Accusation of unsoundness, and our obedience too.</hi> And I think <hi>James</hi> and other places use the word <hi>Justifying</hi> to such a sense; <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61305:243"/> against the Accusation that we are Unbelievers or Hypocrites, and so no performers of the Condition of the New-Covenant.

                        <p n="2">2. Yet I maintain still the dangerousness of this speech, that our <hi>Actions</hi> are justified (through Christ's merits) by the Law of Works, or from the Accusation of sinfulness; and I stand to the Reasons thereof.</p>
                        <p>Now to your words: 1. And first I like not your equivocal definition of Justification, <hi>[the acquitting of us from all sin:]</hi> For it seems to imply, that God esteemeth us not sinners, but freeth us <hi>à Reatu culpae qua talis:</hi> which is impossible.

But remember once more, that God hath made two distinct Covenants or Laws, and that each Law hath his proper Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or else it is no Law: And that to acquit us from the Obligation of the Old-Law, is one Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, consisting in Remission of sin; and the acquitting us from the Obligation of the New-Law, is not by dissolving it, and pardoning it, which is never done, but by justifying us against the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being so obliged: And this is another Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Pardon my so oft repeating the same thing.</p>

                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61305:243"/> 3. When you say, <hi>[Justifying is the acquitting from all sin.]</hi> If by <hi>[Acquitting,]</hi> you mean <hi>[Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning,]</hi> then you must extend it only to all sin against the Law of Works, except that excepted by the Law of Grace; or all sin which Believers were guilty of, but not <hi>all species</hi> of sin. Not the sin against the Holy Ghost, not the final <hi>non-</hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Conditions of the New-Covenant, which leave no remedy.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I am glad of your Concession, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not violated, but by final unbelief.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But I am heartily sorry that you think our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as well as our <hi>persons</hi> are accepted as just, and acquitted from all Accusation brought against them (and that as to the Law of Works) though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they be not such, but that sin doth cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them (as you say.) Against this Doctrine I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Thesis; and I confess my heart detesteth it. I will bring an Accusation against my own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and yours (our Prayers, Alms, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> viz. <hi>They are sinful,</hi> they are breaches of God's Law. How will you be justified from this Accusation? You will not plead, <hi>Not-guilty</hi> I hope, and say, <hi>You do not sin!</hi>

Doth he make the <hi>factum</hi> to be <hi>infectum;</hi> or the word spoken to be unsaid again? <hi>Absit. Nam sicut quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid est, necessariò est, dum est: ita quicquid fuit, vel praeteritum est, necessariò fuit.</hi> The Language of Divines is, it cannot be undone <hi>ne per divinam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam:</hi>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61305:244"/> But is it <hi>morally undone?</hi> How? As I said, God doth not esteem it <hi>[not to have been done,]</hi> much less <hi>[not to have been ill done:]</hi> And as <hi>quod fuit, necessario fuit (necessitate existentiae, ut aiunt:) ita quod malè fuit, necessario malè fuit:</hi> The <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus culpae</hi> therefore cannot possibly be removed or remitted; that is, the man cannot be, or justly esteemed to be, a man that <hi>[sinned not.]</hi> But only the <hi>Reatus poenae</hi> is taken away: God so forgiveth all our sin, that as they induce the <hi>Debitum poenae,</hi> he destroyeth them; and by dissolving the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, freeth us as much from the effects (Eternal Wrath) as if they had never been committed. Is not this enough? But how you will be free from all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of being a sinner, I know not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Do you not fully hereby set up <hi>Justification by the Works of the Law?</hi> For if all your works can be justified from the Accusation of being <hi>sinful,</hi> or breaches of the Law, then why may not the Law ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie you (were it not only for Original sin (or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will except your sins before Conversion.)</p>

                        <p n="4">4. And I will bring this Accusation against your works, from the Law of Works: They are not so far meritorious of Everlasting Life, as that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires they should be.

                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61305:244"/> 5. Yea further, I will bring this Accusation against your works. They are such as deserve Eternal Damnation; yea, and for them you are obliged thereto, immediately upon the doing of them. How will you answer this Accusation? I hope not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it. For if you are not first <hi>obligatus ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> you are not capable of <hi>Remission.</hi> For <hi>Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> is nothing else but the dissolving of that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

                        <p>This I grant would follow, if God did justifie our works for their own sake, as being fully and perfectly righteous; but not if he do it (as he doth) for Christ's sake, pardoning and passing by the imperfection that is in them.

And it seems strange unto me, how you should infer from that saying of some Divines, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61305:245"/> we are justified by our works, when-as the very saying it self is this, That first our persons are justified, and then our works: So that it should rather follow, That our works are justified by us, than that we are justified by our works; though indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth follow, but that both we and our works are justified by Christ, though first we, and then our works; all which (as I have shewed) is agreeable to the Scriptures.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. I know sin is a transgression of the Law; but our Question is, Of what Law? Old or New? and how far?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is not so easie a matter to conceive sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how unbelief and neglect of Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are sins against the Law of Works, or the Precepts of the Decalogue, as belonging to that Law. 1. As to the Decalogue and perceptive part of the Law of Works, as it is merely in <hi>nature,</hi> and was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the first, I conceive it doth command <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and specifie all <hi>natural duties,</hi> and so forbid the <hi>contrary</hi> sin: But it doth not <hi>specifie each particular duties</hi> that <hi>after</hi> were added. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Law of Nature, or Works, doth leave room after the first Institution, for the adding of new<hi>-positives,</hi> without making a new<hi>-form</hi> of the Law as to the <hi>Sanction.</hi> Else every positive that <hi>Moses</hi> added, should have made a New-Law: So of <hi>sacrificing before</hi> Moses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the sence of the Law was, [Obey God in all that he now doth, or hereafter shall command;] and Nature speaks so plainly. And when-ever the <hi>Positive-Command</hi> is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61305:246"/> added in any age, it is a fresh discovery of God's will, which <hi>Nature</hi> obligeth us to obey: The Obligation is as much from the <hi>general Precept</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> as from the <hi>particular</hi> superadded: And though the <hi>general Precept, [Obey all God's Will,]</hi> could not oblige to the particular till it was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet when it is in being it doth oblige even to that particular, <hi>mediante Revelatione,</hi> which enableth us to assume, [but this is God's Will.] The same I say of the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law of Nature: It threatneth Death to <hi>all sin,</hi> even against a Command that was not at the first Institution in being. It saith, [Whosoever sinneth shall die.] So that it is evident that the Law of Nature in its general Precept, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to all particulars that hereafter shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be God's Will. But because I said in my Aphoris. <hi>[That as Faith is to such an end required, so it is not specially commanded by the Law of Works.]</hi> I must partly explain, and partly recant that. For now I think that all duties, with all their ends, are required by the Law of Nature, or that Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth to them; and so to Faith, as it is a means of Remission, though this seemed strange to me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. But here you must distinguish still, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Precept, as it is a Precept, and maketh duty; and the Institution of that duty to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of Life. 2. Between these two Notions, <hi>[The Law of Nature,]</hi> and <hi>[The Law of Works;]</hi> for it is called, <hi>[The Law of Works,]</hi> in reference to the <hi>Sanction,</hi> as Works are made the <hi>Condition</hi> of Life or Death: But it is not called, The Law of Works, when you consider the <hi>Precept</hi> alone, though it command perfection. 3. You must distinguish between the Law of Natures obliging Man in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61305:247"/> and the same Law as continued, obliging man faln; and also obliging man redeemed, and in hopes of Pardon and Life restored. The change of mans state may cause the same Law to oblige him to new-duties. 4. You must distinguish between [The preparing and giving Christ, Grace, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and revealing them to Mankind in the Gospel,] and, [The obliging hereupon to the duty of Believing and Receiving them.] And so I conclude thus for the Solution.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That (as is said) the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> binding us to <hi>Do all that God shall make known to be his Will,</hi> doth oblige us to each <hi>particular,</hi> when it is <hi>made known,</hi> as it doth <hi>generally</hi> oblige to <hi>obedience</hi> before. And so it obligeth even to <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Law of Nature doth <hi>not reveal</hi> Christ, or Grace and Pardon, and Life by him; nor did it make the preparation, by giving Christ to satisfie for sin. This is proper to the Law of Grace, to publish Grace and Christ.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Law of Nature doth not make man any promise of Pardon, Justification and Salvation, if he repent and believe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Law of Nature did not oblige man in Innocency to repent, or return to God, or believe in Christ. For there was not the matter of, or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in us, for such an Obligation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But as soon as ever Man was faln, (even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ was promised) the Law of Nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged faln Man to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to God. But it gave him no hope of pardon on his Repentance: So that it would have been but a despairing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Yet hereby it is apparent, that the Law of Nature maketh us <hi>new-duties,</hi> as our case changeth;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61305:247"/> and some duties proper to <hi>faln Man,</hi> which to the <hi>Innocent</hi> it made not.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Though the Law of Nature neither <hi>give</hi> nor <hi>reveal</hi> Christ, Hope, Pardon, and restored Life, yet when God by Grace hath redeemed us, and given us up to Christ, and revealed Him, and Hope, and Life by him, then the Law of Nature commandeth us to believe God's Revelation, and accept God's gracious offer, and repent and return, and love him that bought us, and be thankful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who feeleth not in himself, that Nature and common Reason obligeth to, or requireth this on the foresaid sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions? So much of the Precept of Natures Law.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Law of Nature continueth to pronounce Death due to every sin, and the greatest punishment due to the greatest sins. And therefore by that Law, Death is due to Unbelief; yea, a far sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than was due to ordinary sins, in that it hath such aggravations. And though it condemned Man for the first sin, and provided him no remedy, yet a remedy being <hi>aliunde</hi> provided, it further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him if he reject it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Though the form of the Law of Works was not altered by God; yet the Obligation (as it were) of the <hi>promisory</hi> or <hi>premiant</hi> part is ceased, upon Man's first sin, through the utter incapacity of Man to receive it. For it promised Life only to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or <hi>innocent;</hi> and the first sin made us all <hi>nocent,</hi> and unmeet subjects. And so Divines use to say, That the Law as <hi>a Covenant</hi> is dissolved; not that the <hi>whole Sanction</hi> is dissolved, but <hi>per cessation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>m,</hi> the promissory part is void, or the Promiser disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by us.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61305:248"/> 9. That therefore which is proper to the New-Law is, that it, 1. Be built on a new foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> Redemption; and so the Legislator is <hi>Deus-Redemptor,</hi> and not only <hi>Deus-Naturae, vel Deus-Creator</hi> as such. 2. That it reveal Christ, and his Sacrifice, and Hope, Pardon and Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That it promise and give all these. 4. That it <hi>institute the Condition</hi> on which they shall be given, or be ours. All these the Law of Nature meddleth not in; though when the <hi>Condition</hi> is instituted, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us not only in general to obey, but in special to obey, and use it to these ends appointed.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Yet no man must think, that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>New-Law</hi> consisteth in these only, and that the <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Threatning</hi> are no true parts of the New-Law, because they are common with the Old: For even these are still true parts of it. Even as the earth that man's body was made of, ceased not to be truly earth when it was made man, nor ceaseth to be a proper or essential part of man, because it is earth. Or as a cup of water taken out of the River, and made Beer, ceaseth not to be water, nor yet can be denied to be Beer. Only it ceaseth to be mere or common water, as our bodies do to be mere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon earth. So here the preceptive part of the Law of Nature, is comprehensive of the Law of Grace, and all Laws that ever will be (supposing those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations <hi>in rerum Natura</hi> which lay the grounds:) But yet, as the Specification of the Covenants or Laws, is (as <hi>Camero</hi> oft, and others) from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and <hi>Sanction,</hi> and so the New-Law is specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence: So it hence assumeth into its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even that which is part of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61305:248"/> so the Precepts of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recovery, are not <hi>common Legal Precepts;</hi> But may be considered as belonging to the Law of Grace, and also to the Law of Nature. So that as man's Soul is specifically distinct from earth, and his Body in it self not so, but as <hi>pars à toto;</hi> but yet is made an essential part of man: So the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive</hi> part of the Law of Grace, is distinct from the Law of Nature, but as <hi>pars à toto;</hi> and yet is made an essential part of that Law, whose <hi>Promise</hi> and Institution of a <hi>Condition qua talis,</hi> is <hi>specifically</hi> distinct from the Law of Nature; and from the whole is denominated as specifically distinct.</p>
                        <p>And hence it is that the Law of Christ is oftner called, a <hi>Testament, Covenant, Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. than a Law: Which hath occasioned the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines (some of them) against Scripture, and all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to deny it to be properly a Law, and confine its whole nature to the foresaid <hi>proper parts,</hi> which <hi>in specie</hi> differ from the Old. It must be known, that as the Righteousness of Faith (in it self, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the New-Law) is but <hi>subservient</hi> to <hi>Christ's Righteousness,</hi> and required for it; so the <hi>New-Law</hi> is a <hi>subservient Law</hi> to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> being but <hi>Lex remedians,</hi> to destroy the Obligation of the Old <hi>(ad poenam)</hi> and conduce to the attaining of its ends.</p>
                        <p>And so much for explication of my thoughts on this point; which I write to satisfie my self as I go on in reviewing my Writings. I think the right stating, and clear apprehension of this point (of the difference between the Law and Gospel, and how far the Law of Works is abrogated) to be of greater moment and difficulty by far, than your

                        <p>The sum of all is, That the <hi>promissory</hi> part of the <hi>Law of Works</hi> doth not oblige, but is destroyed, not by an <hi>Abrogation,</hi> but <hi>Cessation, cessante materia vel capacitate subjecti:</hi> But the <hi>Precept</hi> ceaseth not (except some Positives, which may be added or taken away without alteration in the nature of the Law;) nor the <hi>Threatning</hi> (because <hi>nec abrogatur, nec cessat materia:)</hi> That the <hi>Precept</hi> of the Law of Grace is now under the general Precept of the Law of Nature.

                        <p>The [Moral Law] is usually taken for the mere Preceptive part of the Law of Nature, as absolutely considered without the Sanction: And so the same thing which is the Law of Nature, may be also the directive or preceptive part of the Law of Grace: (Though I am unsatisfied, whether it be sit to say, The Law of Christ doth constitute that duty a-new, and take in the Moral Law as part of it self; or only suppose it, and make use of it.) But you

The Conditions of the New-Covenant are, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe.

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. I still confess, that for <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> and <hi>Impenitency,</hi> men remain <hi>obligati ad poenam per Legem naturae,</hi> till they believe, and so that Obligation be dissolved.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But still I deny it, as to the proper Obligation of the New-Law: For I conceive that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory, remediless and undissolvable. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it both sound and necessary to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between the proper <hi>Violation</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the <hi>temporary non-performance</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Yet I resolve not to contend about the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Name:</hi> If you think the one is as <hi>properly</hi> to be called a <hi>Violation</hi> as the other, and I think not, this is a matter of no great moment. But as to the thing intended by that word, I say, that <hi>Ʋnbelief not final,</hi> is <hi>no such Violation</hi> of the New-Law, as to make us <hi>obligati ad poenam hujus Legis propriam,</hi> or that <hi>this Law</hi> should oblige us to punishment. For else we must say, that Christ came to satisfie his own Law, and be a Mediator between himself, as Mediator, and sinners, which I am loth to say. Indeed the Gospel-Covenant doth <hi>non-liberare,</hi> while men continue their unbelief. But I conceive it doth not <hi>obligare ad poenam propriè, viz. ad non-liberationem &amp; ad poenam majorem,</hi> but for final <hi>non-</hi>performance. For if it do, it is either <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally:</hi> Not <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> (which you here confess;) for then there were <hi>no remedy:</hi> For the <hi>absolute Threat</hi> of the New-Law is <hi>irrevocable</hi> and <hi>remediless.</hi> And if but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,</hi> then it is no Obligation: For it were no Condition, if it suspend not the Act of the Law. If a King say to a company of imprisoned Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61305:251"/> He that will promise a new-life shall be pardoned; and he that will not, shall not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but at the Assizes suffer a double torment. Here the Condition of present Liberation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is present, promising amendment; and for want of present promising, he shall want present Liberation. But the Condition of Liberation or Condemnation at the Assizes, is promising any time between this and then. And so here: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel doth not <hi>remediare, dissolve</hi> the Laws Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as long as we continue impenitent. But it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us not to Condemnation at Judgment, but upon final Unbelief. If yet any say, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>non-Liberation</hi> is <hi>poena novae Legis,</hi> and so far it may be said <hi>obligare:</hi> Though I should rather say, it doth <hi>non dissolvere obligationem,</hi> yet I shall confess, that this <hi>non-Liberation</hi> may in some sort be called <hi>poena,</hi> and I will not stick at this. Only remember that this is nothing to the Obligation, to <hi>sentential Condemnation de futuro,</hi> which we speak of. 2. And that Christ need not die for this: For this <hi>non-libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio dum non credo,</hi> is a penalty that I bear my self <hi>(non enim liberor;)</hi> and therefore Christ need not bear it for me.</p>
                        <p>But I come so lately from a fuller handling this point with another, that I must say no more of it now.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. And for the Autecedent, we must distinguish of the word <hi>[freed from:]</hi> either you mean, that our Liberation is <hi>compleated</hi> (which I deny;) or that it is so effectually begun, that it shall certainly he perfected (which serves not your turn.) The Apostle only saith, <hi>[There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ:]</hi> But as this Text doth not say, <hi>[There shall be none,]</hi> nor promise that they shall never be out of Christ again (though I think others do;) so it saith not that their deliverance from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Condemnation (or which would else be future) is perfected. They are not now under Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor ever shall be; (Is not that all you can hence gather?) and yet they would be to morrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if no more were done than is done. I will be bold to tell you, how far short you are yet from Perfection, even in this matter of Justification.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is a great deal of guilt which will lye on you, from which you are not yet justified <hi>ne qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem constitutivè.</hi> You <hi>will sin</hi> every day, hour and moment; Will you need no Justification from the guilt of these sins? They will condemn you, if
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61305:255"/> you have none. Perhaps a man may have the guilt of ten times more sins to be freed from after his first Justification, than before. If Justification be the same with <hi>Remission of sin</hi> (as very many say, and I know no real difference, as to <hi>constitutive Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;)</hi> then sure you have need of a <hi>particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> upon the renewal of sin, as well as of a <hi>particular Remission,</hi> besides the <hi>universal Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Remission</hi> foregoing: Yea, though they be not the same, yet being so near akin, this will follow. I suppose you will not say, sin is <hi>remitted before committed;</hi> or guilt removed before it is guilt! If you fly to <hi>Amese's, [Virtualiter &amp; in subjecto,] Medul. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27. § 24. that is sure less than <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter &amp; in se</hi> (and indeed is not <hi>Remission;)</hi> and therefore not perfect.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Your Justification either is yet only <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and not <hi>per sententiam judicis,</hi> or else only <hi>quoad sententiam aliquam minus publicam; &amp; non ab omnibus (scil. futuris) peccatis:</hi> Whereas your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification will be <hi>per sententiam judicis,</hi> at that great day, and that from all sin. How could the Apostle say, <hi>[That your sins may be blotted out, when the time of refressing comes,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 3. 19.] if no more be done then to it than now?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Our present Justification freeth us not from God's <hi>Paternal Sentence, and castigatory punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but our future Justification will.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The continuance of Justification while we are here, is but <hi>conditional,</hi> and <hi>de futuro</hi> neither <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> nor <hi>actual.</hi> And a <hi>conditional</hi> Justification is not so much as an absolute. That it is but <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal▪</hi> is evident from the full tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: It saith not, <hi>[He that believeth once, shall be</hi>
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61305:255"/>
                           <hi>for ever justified;</hi> but, <hi>[He that believeth, is or shall be justified;]</hi> that is, as long as he believeth.</p>
                        <p>If you say, <hi>[It is certain they shall believe.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I answer, That altereth not the tenor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: Predestination giveth not Legal Right. It was <hi>certain, vel futurum ab aeterno,</hi> that you should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and persevere; and yet you were not therefore justified. And God only justifieth us <hi>pro praesenti,</hi> and not <hi>pro futuro.</hi> And then it is evident, that conditional Justification is not actual, nor true Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for <hi>conditionale nihil ponit, donec praestetur conditio.</hi> Where there is much means to be used, and conditions yet to be performed, for the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Consummation of our Justification, there it is not yet continued or consummate; nor that person so perfect as to Justification, as he that is past all conditions and means, and so hath his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication consummate, and is in his immutable state. That much means is yet to be used to this end, that our Justification may be continued and consummate, and sentential Justification and Judgment added, if I thought I needed, I could easily and fully prove. Both Prayer, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are means to that end: (of which more toward the end.) And that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are yet to be performed to that end, I will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue on the common Principles (lest you deny Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or Obedience to be such Conditions.) If it be not only the first act of Faith by which men are justified, then their Justification is not so consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate at the first, but that they are still to be justified every day. But it is not only the first act of Faith by which men are justified; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the Antecedent; As it were a wild fancy to exclude all the Faith of a man's life, except the first
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61305:256"/> act; so <hi>Abraham</hi>'s example, as mentioned by the Apostle, contradicteth it expresly. And for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, If following acts of Faith justifie, either by concurring to our first Justification, or by the continuing our universal Justification, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the daily addition of particular Justification and Remission: But it cannot be by concurring to our first Justification; for it is against Scripture and Reason, that I was justified twenty years ago, by believing to day. It is therefore by continuing our universal Justification, and procuring the addition of daily particular Justification: And all this by way of Condition. Now though Perseverance add nothing <hi>ad rei naturam,</hi> yet it is a moral Addition, which must have its Cause; and therefore such Promises are made to <hi>Waiting, Patience, Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> &amp;c. And that man that must have all these Conditions yet to perform, that he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuedly and consummately justified, is not in so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full a sense justified, as he that hath done all. I still profess, that every sort or act of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is perfect in its kind, and as to its proper end; but not of the <hi>perfectest kind,</hi> nor absolutely perfect. He that is in the beginning of the fight, unwounded and safe, is as perfectly safe <hi>quoad natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram rei,</hi> as he that hath gone through all the rest of the dangers, and suffered twenty more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar charges, and overcome all: But he is not safe in so perfect a sense (though you suppose him by a spirit of Prophecy to be sure to scape;) because he hath yet much hazard and labour to go through for the attaining of his safety: And yet we may say as Paul, <hi>If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61305:256"/> means are yet to be used for it. I refer you to Mr. <hi>Burgess</hi> of Justification, <hi>Lect.</hi> 29. which is wholly to prove the point I insist on.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is yet the <hi>solemnizing</hi> of all wanting: And a Marriage not-solemnized is not all so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as that which is.</p>
                        <p>But the main thing that I stand on is, that both Christ's Apologetical Justification of us <hi>qua Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus vel Patronus,</hi> and his <hi>sentential publick Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> at Judgment, do not only differ from ours now; but so much differ, that I think we should fearce be called <hi>justified now,</hi> but in Relation to the Justification then.</p>
                        <p>But you think otherwise, that <hi>[it is not a more full Justification, but a Justification more fully made manifest.]</hi> Many men, many minds: I have sore contest with Mr. <hi>L.</hi> and all will not convince him, that <hi>any but sentential</hi> is properly <hi>Justification:</hi> And that which I call <hi>Constitutive, &amp; in sensu Legis,</hi> is but <hi>Right to Justification.</hi> I easily yield to you, that the Law or Grant of Grace doth its own work perfectly, in <hi>constitutive Justification.</hi> But yet I make no doubt to affirm, that though Justification <hi>constitutive</hi> be <hi>proper Justification;</hi> yet the word is more commonly used by Lawyers and Protestant Divines, for <hi>Justification by sentence:</hi> And so the Law justifieth but <hi>virtually,</hi> and not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> at all (as to this <hi>sentential Justification.)</hi> To absolve from a Crime and Penalty, and <hi>adjudicare praemium, contra actoris accusationem,</hi> is the most full, perfect Justification of all. And it's exceeding strange, that you should think it nothing but a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification made manifest, when it is another sort of Justification <hi>toto coelo,</hi> different from <hi>constitutive:</hi>
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61305:257"/> Or if you mean, it is but a fuller Manifestation of some <hi>sentential Justification,</hi> which we have now by Faith; you should have said so, and should shew what <hi>that Sentence</hi> is, <hi>&amp; in quo foro? per quem judicem? &amp; quinam sint actus judiciales? &amp; cujus generis sit decisio absolutoria?</hi> when I had brought that so far into question. But I conceive there is more in the <hi>Sentence of the Judg,</hi> than <hi>Manifestation. Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Judicis est pars decisionis litis, quae est causae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversae per judicem determinatio:</hi> Without it there is ordinarily no full <hi>jus in re &amp; possessio</hi> of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge or Reward in question: It is more fully ours after the Judgment than before. Nor is there a perfect <hi>Liberation</hi> from the Crime and Penalty which we are charged to be guilty of: <hi>Haec enim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ad sententiae executionem, quae sententiam ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam praesupponit. Decretum est pars secunda judicii. Decernere est post causae cognitionem statuere. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere est quid majus quam manifestare. Manifestant testes, evidentiae, ipse reus, &amp;c. Sed non statuunt, decernunt, nec per sententiam absolvunt.</hi> That Adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of everlasting Reward or Punishment at the Judgment-day, will be more than mere Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It will be the most full, proper, perfect Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which then we shall receive; which I think Scripture more respecteth in this point, than some observe; and I think it is in order to that great Justification that our present Justification obtains the name.</p>
                        <p>Again, I would argue thus: If Justification be opposed to Condemnation, and the Condemnation by publick Sentence be quite different in kind from Condemnation now <hi>in Law</hi> (or any sentential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that I know of) then Justification by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61305:257"/> publick Sentence, is as different from Justification in Law: But the former is true; therefore so is the latter. I say therefore as <hi>Camero,</hi> Praelect. de Verbo Dei, pag. 462.

                        <p>But suppose the Sentence did only <hi>declare:</hi> It may yet be as true and proper a kind of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>constitutive;</hi> if we consider, that it is not the Declaration of a private person, but of the Supreme Judg: And a <hi>Declaration</hi> in opposition to <hi>Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ne succedat)</hi> and <hi>Condemnation (ne sit;)</hi> and which must determine the case finally, Whether we shall be in Heaven or Hell.</p>
                        <p>But you say, <hi>[You see not how I can deny our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to be perfect, when I say our Righteousness is perfect.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I answer you by two necessary distinctions:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I deny not but our <hi>constitutive Justification</hi> is <hi>perfect;</hi> and that's all that can be gathered from the perfection of our Righteousness. But I deny that our <hi>constitutive Justification</hi> is the <hi>most perfecting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat sort of Justification;</hi> or yet that our <hi>sentential Justification</hi> is <hi>now perfect.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. You must distinguish of <hi>Perfection,</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the <hi>present subject,</hi> and as the same thing <hi>materially</hi> is compared to <hi>another subject,</hi> or to the <hi>future state</hi> of that subject: And so I say, that we are <hi>perfectly justified constitutivè</hi> the first day we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, considering it as the <hi>present Righteousness</hi> of us in that present state: And yet that is not <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi> so perfect a Justification, as that which we have of the same kind at our death: For we are then justified from millions of sins more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61305:258"/> and all the Conditions are performed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had but the same Justification materially at death, which we had at our first believing, that is, were justified from no more sins, it would be no perfect Justification to us, but a partial and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar one. A Childs shooe is meet for his foot, and a mans is no more: But the same shooe which was meet for him when he was a Child, will not be meet when he is a man: Yea, if it be the skin on his foot, it must grow as he grows, or it will not be meet; and yet <hi>Meetness</hi> formally is one and the same thing. This is it that I told you before, that the matter of our Righteousness; <hi>viz.</hi> Our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations and actions (commonly called Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness) hath degrees, though Righteousness as such, hath none.</p>

                        <p>Here I give you notice, that though the <hi>act</hi> of Faith be most directly the Condition, yet I think
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61305:259"/> the <hi>habit</hi> is so intimately included in the true, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, intense act, and is so little different in nature from it, that even the <hi>habit</hi> may be also called the <hi>Condition,</hi> and we be said to be justified by it. And indeed I think that the Scripture, when it speaks of being <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> doth in the word <hi>[Faith]</hi> include both <hi>act and habit.</hi> And I am conceited, that they less differ in their nature <hi>(an act and an habit of the Soul)</hi> than many Philosophers think: especially this would be evident, if <hi>Scotus</hi> were in the right, that <hi>intellectio &amp; volitio</hi> compleated, which we call <hi>immanent Acts,</hi> are not in the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament of <hi>Action,</hi> but of <hi>Quality,</hi> in the same <hi>species</hi> as <hi>Habits:</hi> Or if some others opinion be true, that <hi>Habits</hi> are but in the intellect the <hi>Species</hi> or Images deeply imprinted, and in the Will either none (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the intellectual) or only a continued action, though sometimes so imperfect and obscure, that it is not perceived or felt, as being less vigorous and express than other actions which then are felt. Sure I am, if other men be no wiser than I, their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the true nature of <hi>Habits,</hi> with their difference from <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Acts,</hi> is not so clear as may embolden a man with confidence, to reject <hi>Habits</hi> from being the <hi>Condition,</hi> and so having a hand with the <hi>act</hi> in our Justification. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can truly be said, that the Habit is required only for the act, and not for it self, I cannot tell: I rather think otherwise. This I write, partly in Explication, and partly in Recantation of some things before delivered on this point, <hi>Thes.</hi> 57. which I think my self bound to do on more through Consideration.</p>

                           <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61305:260"/> 2. In your second note: 1. You quite forget what you were to prove: It was not that the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> of Faith is the Instrument, but the <hi>Act:</hi> For that is the common Doctrine, and that which I was there opposing. The <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Hand,</hi> and and not the <hi>Hand,</hi> is it that you should prove the Instrument. You will not get all to confess, that the <hi>act</hi> of Faith is not the Instrument of receiving Christ, nor yet of Justification. 2. And if the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> were granted to be the Instrument of receiving Christ, yet could it with no fitness be said, in the sense of our Divines, that Faith justifieth as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,</hi> because they say, It is not the <hi>habit</hi> of Faith that justifieth, but the <hi>act:</hi> And you say, It is not the <hi>Act</hi> that is the Instrument, but the <hi>Habit;</hi> therefore it plainly follows, that (according to this Doctrine) Faith cannot justifie as an Instrument. 3. I do not think that the <hi>Habit</hi> is properly the Souls Instrument. It is nothing but the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Faculty;</hi> and its <hi>Perfection</hi> is too near to it self, to be properly its <hi>Instrument.</hi> Though in some sort we may say, that the <hi>inferiour Powers</hi> are the <hi>Wills Instruments</hi> in <hi>imperate Acts;</hi> yet I do not think that the <hi>elicite Acts</hi> (such as are the acts of Faith) are performed by <hi>Instruments,</hi> except we may call the Body, the Spirits animal or vital, the Souls <hi>Instruments:</hi> (For though the Soul be <hi>inorganical,</hi> and depend not on the Body <hi>subjectivè &amp; efficienter,</hi> yet I think it doth <hi>objectivè &amp; occasionaliter,</hi> as <hi>Heereboord</hi> explains it <hi>(Disput. Philos.</hi> 43. §. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 615.) If we must not allow the Soul <hi>exterior organs,</hi> as <hi>efficients</hi> of its <hi>elicite Acts,</hi> I think we should have better grounds before we assert these <hi>intrinsick organs.</hi> We must make no unnecessary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61305:260"/> in the Soul. Your similitude therefore of <hi>[the Hand enriching]</hi> is not to the purpose: For the hand is an integral part of the man, but no essential, and therefore may be called his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Habit,</hi> is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of his most <hi>essential</hi> part: And we think it not proper to say, that the soundness or perfection of the Brain or Heart are their Instruments. Or if it might be so said of the Body, yet must we be more cautelous in ascribing Divisions, Compositions and Instrumentality to the Soul. If any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (according to your similitude of a Hand) must be called the Instrument of receiving Christ, it must be that part of the Soul which receiveth him: But the Soul receiveth him not by parts, but intirely: The receiving Faculties are the Understanding (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductorily) and the Will (perfectively:) And to say that these are our Instruments of receiving, is to say, that the Soul is the Soul's Instrument, or Man's Instrument. If the meaning be, that the Soul is God's Instrument, I confess so some Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers and Divines usually say of all second Causes, that they are the Instruments of God the first Cause: But I know this is not your meaning, and therefore it might seem injurious or unnecessary to load it with the absurdities which follow it in our case.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Besides, it must be considered, that Faith is not a proper <hi>natural receiving,</hi> but a <hi>moral imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive receiving</hi> only. It is indeed <hi>a physical Act,</hi> but not <hi>a physical Reception.</hi> For, 1. <hi>Credere est agere, sed recipere est pati: ergo credere non est recipere, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su physico &amp; proprio.</hi> 2. The Object is not <hi>natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter receptible</hi> by our Faith: For, 1. If you say it is <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> that is the <hi>Object.</hi> I answer,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61305:261"/> 1. That it was given to God, and not to us; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and not we that was to be satisfied: It is only given to us in its <hi>fruits</hi> or benefits procured thereby, and not in it self. 2. If it were, yet it is not physically receptible. 2. If you say, It is <hi>[Righteousness]</hi> as ours, procured by Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: I say, Righteousness is a Relation, and not <hi>physically receptible agendo vel apprehendendo.</hi> 3. If you say that Christ himself is the Object; who knows not that our Faith doth not <hi>physically</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ himself? So that it's undeniable, that Faith is <hi>actio physica, sed receptio tantum moralis vel imputativa:</hi> And therefore (if all were granted, that before is gainsaid) the Habit of Faith could be no other Instrument of receiving, but moral or imputative.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Lastly, Let it be considered also, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>justifying Faith</hi> is not the <hi>direct receiving</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> but the <hi>receiving of Christ himself,</hi> as he is offered to us in the Gospel; that so <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and other benefits may <hi>follow</hi> thereupon. So that it is but remotely, that justifying Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Righteousness: So that as it is unmeet to say, that a Womans Habit of consenting, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of enriching her, because she marrieth a man that is rich; so much more is it here. Indeed it is a phrase that containeth a whole heap of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors and Metonymies in it.</p>
                        <p>But what need I contest any further with you, who are of the same judgment as I, and yield so willingly to all that I desire; that is, <hi>[That to speak exactly, Faith may better be called a Condition, than an Instrument of our Justification:]</hi> Why then do you except against my Exceptions against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61305:261"/> phrase? If it satisfie you that I bear with the phrase, acknowledging itself improper (which I think is all you desire) then you may be satisfied in the words of mine you last cite: For I love not word-quarrels. But if you think, that I should have overlooked that impropriety, and not have gain-said it: I answer, indeed so I willingly would, but for these Reasons which forbid me: 1. Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ordinarily use the phrase, as if it were exact and proper in their strictest Disputes. 2. They make the Instrumentality of Faith to Justification, the common refuge against many Objections, and the inlet of other mistakes. 3. They are impatient with any that deny it. 4. But that which chiefly moved me was, that they make this a main Fundamental difference between us and the Papists, as if for this one thing (if you joyn also their denial of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christ's personal active Righteousness, as our <hi>formaliter, &amp; non tantum meritorie)</hi> which you and I deny as well as the Papists, and so doth every Divine save one, that hath yet afforded me their Animadversions; and what that one doth, I know not:) I say, as if for denying this, they were certainly damned. I confess it deeply troubleth me to read so ordinarily in our most famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so much of the Reformed Cause to be laid on a plain Errour. 5. And when Papists read this in ours Writings, it so hardeneth them in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they think presently, that all the rest of our Doctrine is like this, and they cast away all in prejudice, and insult over us, and cleave the faster to all the rest of their Errours, to their souls ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. Judg impartially, Whether these Reasons were not sufficient to constrain me to find fault
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61305:262"/> with this phrase of Instrumentality? 1. Specially if you do but add, that it is no phrase of the Holy Ghost, but of man's devising; and therefore I know not why I should in such a case be so tender of it.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. The meaning of the Holy Ghost is to be gathered, by comparing one place of Scripture with another.

                        <p n="3">3.

                        <p n="1">1. I hold fast the literal sense of Scripture, not as opposed to figurative (as the Papists in that point do;) but as it signifieth the plain meaning of the words, opposed to far-fetch'd forced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For the figurative is oft the plain express sense, which is to be received according to the common use of those words, Again, if the Papists had divers express Texts of Scripture for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61305:263"/> their opinion, and we had none against them, I would be of their mind. It is a desperate thing to forsake the plain sense of God's Word, because Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists adhere to the literal sense of one Text, against the plain more obvious figurative sense, when also other Scriptures contradict them. If express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be no proof, when-ever men can put a forced sense on it, or cannot reconcile it with other, what is a proof?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I agree to your Rule of Interpretation. But as to the Application, 1. You confess we are said to be justified by Faith; and I confess we are justified by Christ. But doth it follow, that therefore we are not justified by Faith, because we are justified by Christ? we are not fed by our hands or teeth, because we are fed by our meat? 2. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was about <hi>[imputing for Righteousness.]</hi> The Scripture saith, <hi>[Faith is imputed for Righteousness,]</hi> but it no-where saith, <hi>Christ or his Righteousness is imputed to us for Righteousness.</hi> Now the Question is, Whether by <hi>[Faith,]</hi> the Scripture mean <hi>(not Faith,</hi> but) <hi>[Christ,</hi> or his <hi>Righteousness]</hi> and that only? He that will affirm this, must prove it. And do you indeed think, that when Scripture saith, <hi>[Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteousness,]</hi> James 2. 23. Rom. 4. 22, 23, 24. that by <hi>[it]</hi> is meant <hi>[Christ,]</hi> or <hi>[Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?]</hi> Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Goodwin,</hi> have said enough of this. Do you by <hi>[Faith]</hi> mean <hi>[Christ,]</hi> when you say, <hi>We are justified by Faith?</hi> Do not you confess that we are <hi>truly</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Faith itself,</hi> as the <hi>Condition,</hi> as well as by Christ as the <hi>meritorious Cause?</hi> Why then do you oppose the same in me? It may you will say, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61305:263"/> I say, Faith justifieth as our Righteousness. I answer, 1. That is not the Question now under hand; but, Whether it be <hi>Christ only,</hi> and <hi>not Faith.</hi> 2. In regard of that Justification which I believe you mean, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Accusation of the Law of Works as such: I say, <hi>Faith is but a Condition,</hi> and no otherwise justifieth. But because it is <hi>made that Condition by a New-Law, per legem remediantem,</hi> and we must be judged by <hi>that Law;</hi> therefore when the case is, Whether we have performed the Conditions of that New-Law or not? then Faith is <hi>materially that Righteousness</hi> by which we must be justified, against all Accusations of <hi>non-performance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. I have still acknowledged the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness <hi>sanosensu;</hi> (that is, 1. <hi>Per Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem ejus fructus:</hi> And, 2. <hi>Per Adjudicationem justitiae, nobis inde promeritae;)</hi> but yet I see no such evidence in your Consequence, that should force me to leave the plain sense of any Text. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent I embrace, <hi>[All that believe in Christ are justified;]</hi> But I see not how it follows, [therefore <hi>they are justified only by Christ's Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and not by Faith imputed;]</hi> (for that's it you must say, or you say nothing to the point.) Indeed you must interpret Imputation very fairly, before you can hence prove Imputation it self, much less the sole Imputation.</p>

                        <p>I know no reason to deny this: But the New-Covenant containeth more in it than Justification; and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that all other things which make up the Condition of the New-Covenant, must go before Justification, as the Condition requisite for the obtaining of it.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Pink</hi>'s Interpretation (as I remember, for I have not his Book by me now, though I have read it long ago) is this, that when it is said, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. <hi>Her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much:</hi> The particle <hi>for</hi> imports as much as <hi>therefore.</hi> His meaning is, that her loving much was not the cause why many sins were forgiven her; but this, that many sins were forgiven her, was the cause that she loved

                        <p n="1">1. I know not why this should seem strange, if it be rightly understood. You say a little after, <hi>[Affiance, and sincere Obedience, and works of Love, are the necessary, immediate, inseparable products of Faith:]</hi> So the Apostle saith, <hi>That saith worketh through love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Indeed I do not see how sincere Obedience, and works of Love, are the immediate products of Faith, as <hi>Affiance</hi> is. But, to let that pass; that they are the products of Faith, who will deny?</p>

                        <p n="2">2. As Affiance directly follows the Acceptance of Christ, as one to be trusted in; so internal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence directly followeth accepting of Christ, as King to rule us.</p>

But it is confessed to be no good reason to exclude Affiance; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, if Affiance be but a fruit of the principal act of justifying Faith, and yet justifie it self, then it is not any one act on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that justifieth: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Justifying Faith is the motion of the <hi>whole Soul to Christ.</hi> It containeth therefore the action of <hi>both Faculties.</hi> In the <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> Assent is its act, and the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> is <hi>its nearest object,</hi> though not its <hi>chief</hi> (as I opened my meaning, <hi>p.</hi> 260.) For as <hi>Ames. Medul.</hi> l. 2. c. 5. §. 23, 24. <hi>Hoc objectum est immediatè semper aliquod axioma vel enunciatio sub ratione veri, sed illud in quo principaliter terminatur fides, de quo &amp; propter quod assensus praebetur illi axiomati per fidem, est ens incomplexum sub ratione boni,</hi> Rom. 4. 21. Heb. 11. 13. <hi>Actus (enim) credentis non terminatur ad axioma, sed ad rem, fatentibus scholasticorum clarissimis. Ratio est: quia non formamus axiomata, nisi ut per ea de rebus cognitionem habeamus. Principalis igitur ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus in quem tendit actus credentis, est res ipsa, quae in axiomate praecipue spectatur.</hi> But as the act of the <hi>Ʋnderstanding</hi> is but <hi>preparatory,</hi> introductory and subservient to that of the <hi>Will,</hi> whereby the Soul cleaveth to <hi>God as good,</hi> being but the <hi>means</hi> to it, or the imperfect Rudiments of it: So <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Promise,</hi> is but such an initial or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61305:269"/> act, as to <hi>Consent,</hi> or the <hi>Wills Acceptance</hi> of the <hi>good offered.</hi> These acts of the intellect (in affectionate or practical matters) are but imperfect acts of the Soul, and so but <hi>imperfecte humani vel morales:</hi> And therefore we commonly distinguish <hi>intellectual</hi> Acts and Vertues from <hi>moral.</hi> Not that I think they are not truly <hi>humani &amp; morales,</hi> but it is in a more <hi>imperfect kind;</hi> as the digestion in the stomach, before Sanguification: Nor do I agree to <hi>Amesius,</hi> who placeth justifying Faith <hi>only in the Will</hi> (no more than to <hi>Camero,</hi> who placeth it <hi>only</hi> in the <hi>Intellect:)</hi> But till it come to the Will, it is not <hi>perfect,</hi> nor so fully to be ascribed to the <hi>whole man.</hi> And therefore saith <hi>Gibieuf</hi> de Libert. <hi>Finis intellectus est veri notitia, sed finis hominis intelligentis est amor Dei.</hi> As the <hi>sense</hi> is <hi>for the Intellect,</hi> so the <hi>Intellect</hi> is <hi>for the Will</hi> here. And therefore it is the act of the <hi>Will</hi> that is the <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>principal act</hi> of justifying Faith, and the object of that act is the <hi>proper principal object</hi> of justifying Faith.</p>
                        <p>Now this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat principal act <note place="margin">I mean not by all this, that only this which I call the principal act, is the Condition of our Justification; but that it is the most <hi>special</hi> act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the rest, as the generical. Yea, and the sinal object is the principal in excellency; as the end is better than the means as such, though the mediate object be the special proper object.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61305:269"/> its proper material object; but Christ himself, as in his Office, and <hi>to the ends</hi> and <hi>uses</hi> of that Office; and so the benefits are final or remoter objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and still implied. The accepting of the <hi>Word,</hi> or the accepting of <hi>Justification,</hi> are neither of them this <hi>compleat special act of justifying Faith;</hi> but the <hi>accepting of Christ.</hi> As the act wherein the essence of Marriage doth principally consist, is not believing each others <hi>words</hi> (which is pre-requisite) nor yet accepting the riches or honours of each other: But accepting each other in the Conjugal Relations; or the <hi>Wills consent</hi> (and its <hi>expression,</hi> if we speak of it <hi>quoad forum exterius.)</hi> And the Condition of a womans enjoying her Husband's honour and estate, is not principally her <hi>believing him,</hi> nor yet her <hi>accepting his honour and estate;</hi> but her <hi>accepting himself in Marriage.</hi> So I think it is here. Yet the truth of God or his Word, is the object of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory initial act of justifying Faith, called <hi>Assent.</hi> Methinks this is so plain, that you may well know what to make of it. <hi>Ne{que} nobis absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum videtur, sed valde consentaneum, actum illum quo tota anima Purificatur &amp; Justificatur ad totam animam pertinere: ita ut in nudo intellectu habeat mitium, in voluntate complementum.</hi> Davenant.

                        <p n="1">1. The Arguments which you use, prove only thus much, that Christ must be received as well in respect of his Kingly, as in respect of his Priestly Office; But not that we are justified by the one, as well as by the other.

                        <p n="1">1. I think the Arguments used, if rightly taken, prove more than you say. But because I come new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from manifesting their forms and vigour, to two or or three other Learned Animadverters, I shall not attempt it again on this short invitation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You confess I have proved the receiving Christ as King, to be the <hi>fides quae Justificat:</hi> And then it belongs <hi>to you</hi> to prove the <hi>exclusion</hi> of it in this Consideration: Scripture saith, <hi>We are justified by faith:</hi> You confess, it is by <hi>this faith,</hi> or <hi>this act:</hi> If therefore you say moreover, <hi>It is by this,</hi> but <hi>not as such,</hi> you must prove the <hi>exclusion</hi> of that respect; for <hi>ubi Lex nec distinguit nec limitat, non est distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum vel limitandum.</hi> He therefore that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Distinction or Limitation, must prove it. Which I despair of seeing well done here.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I reverence those Learned Divines, that use to distinguish of the <hi>fides quae,</hi> and the <hi>fides quâ:</hi> But indeed, I am past doubt, that it is here a useless di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and only built on a begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The word <hi>[qua]</hi> respecteth either <hi>[Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,]</hi>
                           <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61305:270"/> or, <hi>[fides.] Fides quâ Justificat, tantum Justificat: Ita enim loquimur non quid sit, sed quid producit.</hi> If you refer <hi>[qua]</hi> to <hi>[fides,]</hi> so as to mean, <hi>Fides quâ Christi sacerdotis apprehensio Justificat, &amp; tantum quâ talis:</hi> Then, 1. This is inconveniently expressed, to say <hi>[qua Justificat,]</hi> instead of <hi>[quâ Christum apprehendit.]</hi> 2. And it is a begging of the Question. It supposeth, that <hi>[haec fides, vel hic fidei actus qua talis, &amp; non qua conditio formaliter Justificat,]</hi> which I deny: Yea, and it supposeth that <hi>solus hic actus Justificat,</hi> which is also denied.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I would you would shew me, in what sense or respect it is, that the <hi>receiving of Christ as King</hi> doth <hi>justifie.</hi> You say, it is the <hi>fides quae Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat:</hi> And then it is certainly <hi>a justifying act:</hi> Now if it do justifie, and yet not <hi>qua talis,</hi> as such as it is, then as what? It is not the same act most say, as the <hi>receiving Christ as Priest:</hi> Will you say, <hi>[The receiving Christ as King]</hi> doth justifie, as it is the receiving him <hi>as Priest?</hi> that were to say, <hi>[by doing that which it doth not,]</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common judgment. <note place="margin">Of this read what I have written at large against Mr. <hi>Warner,</hi> about the Object of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Faith.</note> But if you mean, that it is the <hi>same Habit,</hi> which performeth <hi>both Acts,</hi> and only <hi>one</hi> of the Acts justifie: I say, you should then call the <hi>Habit only,</hi> and that <hi>one Act,</hi> the <hi>fides quae;</hi> and not <hi>that act</hi> which is not the <hi>fides quae</hi> (in your esteem.)</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>[quâ]</hi> should signifie the <hi>formal Reason</hi> of its <hi>interest</hi> in the work of Justifying. But that (I think I have proved, and shall do) is not <hi>its nature,</hi> as it is <hi>this Act</hi> or <hi>that</hi> (that is but <hi>its Aptitude</hi> to this Office) but its being the <hi>Condition</hi> of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61305:271"/> which <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>instituted,</hi> and <hi>man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> If therefore it justifie not <hi>qua fides, vel quâ hic actus,</hi> but <hi>quâ conditio praestita,</hi> then <hi>every Act</hi> must justifie, which is such <hi>a Condition:</hi> For <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet argumentum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Your own Argument I grant wholly <hi>[If Christ as Priest satisfied.</hi> &amp;c.] But all you conclude is, that [therefore <hi>by receiving him as Priest we are justified.]</hi> But who denieth it? You left out <hi>ly [only:]</hi> Which had you put in, I had denied the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with that addition. It is such another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as this: <hi>If a man only as rich, do enrich his wife; and only as honourable, do honour her; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as merciful and potent, doth deliver her from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: then the Act on her part which enricheth her, is only the receiving him as a rich man; and not as an honourable man, nor as a husband only: And the Act which dignifieth her, is only the receiving him as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</hi> No such matter! But the receiving him as a <hi>Husband</hi> (though she never look to his riches or honour) is that Act on her part, which <hi>giveth right</hi> to his riches, honour and all: And then these benefits are but consequential thereto.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Let me therefore here once for all (that you may understand my meaning) tell you, That when we say <hi>[Faith justifies in this respect, and not in that,] distinguendum est:</hi> Either we speak <hi>ex parte objecti</hi> only, in what respect the <hi>Object received</hi> doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; or else <hi>ex parte actus nostri,</hi> in what respect <hi>our Act of Faith</hi> justifieth: And so I affirm <hi>ex parte ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti</hi> (I speak not <hi>de objecto formaliter, sed materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in se)</hi> that <hi>Christ received,</hi> doth not justifie <hi>(sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily</hi> and <hi>meritoriously)</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> but as <hi>Priest:</hi> (Though yet <hi>sententialiter &amp; ut efficiens principalis,</hi>
                           <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61305:271"/> he justifies as <hi>King.)</hi> But if the Question be, <hi>Ex parte actus nostri?</hi> I say, it is not our receiving Christ <hi>as Priest only,</hi> nor as <hi>King,</hi> but as the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-God-man,</hi> to be our <hi>Head, Husband, Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> that justifieth, as being the <hi>Condition</hi> on which Justification is <hi>given</hi> us: And so receiving him <hi>as King,</hi> hath <hi>as near</hi> a hand in it, as receiving him as <hi>Priest;</hi> (for this is that <hi>part of the Condition</hi> which the World <hi>most sticks</hi> at.) As in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned similitude <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> the <hi>husbands dignity</hi> doth not <hi>enrich</hi> the wife, nor his <hi>riches ennoble</hi> her: But <hi>ex parte actus,</hi> as to the <hi>Condition</hi> on <hi>her part,</hi> it is <hi>undivided</hi> as to the essential Matrimonial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, <hi>viz.</hi> [That she take the man to be <hi>her husband,</hi> to be loved, obeyed, and faithfully cleave to him only:] But the respect to his <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> in marrying him, is not that which gives her title to them; (that is, but collaterally requisite, if at all,) but her first having right <hi>in him,</hi> whose they are.</p>

Faith justifieth not directly, as it apprehendeth Christ's Satisfaction (you should say, <hi>Righteousness</hi> which was <hi>merited by it:</hi> For the <hi>Satisfaction it self</hi> was never <hi>offered to us,</hi> but <hi>given to God for us;</hi> unless by <hi>apprehending,</hi> you mean only <hi>assenting</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of it:) But Faith justifieth directly or <hi>formally,</hi> as the <hi>Condition of the Gift;</hi> and <hi>material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>aptitudinally,</hi> as the <hi>receiving of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> And then his Righteousness is to follow our Union or Marriage to him.

                        <p>This is a point of greater moment than to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: But as to your Objection, it is of most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile solution. There are two acts of God's Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be distinguished, which you confound: 1. One is his <hi>making</hi> the <hi>conditional Covenant</hi> or. <hi>Gift:</hi> This was a <hi>natural act</hi> past long ago, and our <hi>Acceptance</hi> supposeth it past. 2. The second is the <hi>moral act</hi> of this <hi>Covenant, Deed of Gift,</hi> or Law once made. This <hi>moral action</hi> is considerable, 1. As <hi>before</hi> our performance of the Condition; and that is imperfect, and properly no action, as to <hi>giving:</hi> For it is essential to a Condition, to <hi>suspend</hi> the act of the Law, Grant, or other instrumental Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. But when the <hi>Condition is performed,</hi> then the Law or Covenant doth <hi>truly agere</hi> or <hi>significare,</hi> and <hi>give Christ</hi> and <hi>Righteousness.</hi> For though the Instrument were in <hi>being before,</hi> yet it did not <hi>agere vel efficere,</hi> till the Condition was performed. And this is common in moral Action▪ or Efficiency, to delay so long, and begin on such terms: And the reason is, because all its force for Action is from the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Law-giver</hi> or <hi>Donor:</hi> For it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but as <hi>signum voluntatis ejus.</hi> Now it is <hi>his Will</hi> that a conditional Grant shall not act, or be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al till the Condition be performed, and therefore it cannot before. If a man make a <hi>Testament,</hi> giving so much to such a Son when he marrieth, and so much to another on such a <hi>Condition</hi> (as if it were but <hi>thankful Acceptance)</hi> this <hi>Testament</hi> will <hi>not give</hi> them any <hi>actual right,</hi> till the <hi>Condition</hi> be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So I answer you; Our <hi>Acceptance</hi> supposeth <hi>God's Grant,</hi> as made in the <hi>Instrument,</hi> and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it <hi>conditionally</hi> to be ours; but as truly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61305:277"/> that <hi>actually</hi> it is <hi>not ours</hi> till <hi>Acceptance;</hi> the Law till then suspending its act. Indeed if it had been an <hi>absolute Grant,</hi> it had been otherwise: For then the receiving would have been necessary only in natural, and not moral respect; and only <hi>ad possessionem &amp; non ad jus.</hi> And yet some Grants use to be made in <hi>phrase</hi> of <hi>absolute ones,</hi> which yet imply <hi>Consent</hi> or <hi>Receiving</hi> to be <hi>conditional,</hi> because it is seldom convenient to make over any gift upon other terms: (Yet sometimes it is.) Can you think indeed (as you seem to intend) that all God's Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is past before we believe, and that he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after? Why then he justifieth men before Faith <hi>ex parte sui,</hi> as fully as after; and the Reprobate as fully as the Elect: But both these are false. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God doth no natural action after (it is <hi>ex vi Legislationis,</hi> that the <hi>Law</hi> doth still afterward act) but the <hi>moral act</hi> of his Law, which is <hi>debitum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituere, jus conferre,</hi> is <hi>after our Faith immediately:</hi> and this is the act that we are chiefly to look at. You say, the Gospel-Covenant is held out to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and what of that? Doth it therefore <hi>give right in Christ to Ʋnbelievers?</hi> Or doth <hi>Faith</hi> it self <hi>give</hi> that <hi>right?</hi> Or did God before give it <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and they only lose the possession for want of a Reception merely natural? No, none of all this.</p>

                        <p n="2">2.

But he that receives him only as Priest, and not as King, doth not receive him as Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture calleth him <hi>Christ, the Anointed,</hi> more fully and frequently, in respect to the Kingly part of his Office than any. A false Faith doth not justifie: But to receive Christ only as a Priest, and not as King, is a false Faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, He that knows not Christ to be the King of the Church by Office, and <hi>de jure</hi> the <hi>Ruler</hi> of his Soul, knows him not with a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg (no more than he that knows not that a man hath a head, but only a heart, hath a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of man;) therefore so to receive him is no true receiving. And if he know him to be King, and yet receive him not as such, then it is worst of all. Lastly, To receive Christ so as he was never offered, is no true receiving: But to receive him as Priest only, is so to receive him as he was never offered;

                        <p>It cannot indeed be doubted, but that St. <hi>James</hi> doth say so: But the Question is not of his words, but of his meaning. And it may seem strange, that you should so censure that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, which is generally received by Protestants, as to make it contradictory to the Text. The Papists say as much about those words, <hi>[This is my Body;]</hi> and they have as much reason for what they say as you have, for any thing I can see. For the meaning of St. <hi>James,</hi> whom you think to be so clear and full for you, it's needless to shew what our Divines do say, even <hi>Cajetan</hi> himself upon the place saith, <hi>Jacobus docet quod non side sterili, sed fide soecunda operibus Justificantur.</hi> And this indeed seems to be S. <hi>Jame</hi>'s meaning by his whole Discourse, from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the end of the Chapter, where he bends himself against such as presume of Faith, though it be without Works, which Faith Protestants generally deny to be which justifieth. More especially consider, that St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified by works, when he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up his son upon the altar:</hi> And that the Scripture was <hi>fulfilled, which saith,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Righteousness,</hi> v. 21, &amp; 23. This clearly shews (methinks) that <hi>Abraham</hi> was only so justified by Works, and not by Faith only, as that he was justified, not by a barren and idle, but by a fruitful and working Faith, his Works shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Faith to be true justifying Faith indeed. For that <hi>[Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,]</hi> was said of him long before that he offered up <hi>Isaac,</hi> as the story in <hi>Genesis</hi> doth shew: and by those very words doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> prove that Justification is by Faith, and not by Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Therefore when S. <hi>James</hi> saith, that by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up of <hi>Isaac,</hi> that Scripture was fulfilled, I know nor how it can be otherwise understood, than that thereby it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it was truly said of <hi>Abraham, That he believed God,</hi> &amp;c. His willingness to obey God in so great a work, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he believed indeed, and that his Faith was such, as whereby he was justified. So when St. <hi>James</hi> saith, That by Works <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was made perfect; the meaning is, that his Works shewed his Faith to be perfect, that is, a true justifying Faith; even as God's strength is said to be made
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61305:280"/> perfect in our weakness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>i. e</hi> the greatness of his power is seen in our weakness: For it is certain, that our weakness can add nothing to God's power, though it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">

Surely I have read of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Interpretations by Protestants, one contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what others maintain; and therefore they do not so generally hold to one. Some say, It speaks of Justification <hi>coram Deo;</hi> some say, only <hi>coram hominibus;</hi> some, that it speaks of the Justification of the <hi>person;</hi> others, only of the Justification of his <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To your <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> I answered before. It were an odd thing, if when we bring the express words of Scripture for any proof, it should be put off by <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum;</hi> or, <hi>Ego sum Vitis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The words you cite, <hi>vers.</hi> 21, 23. will not prove what you intend. For if it be meant of <hi>[Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification immediately on our first believing,]</hi> or our <hi>Justification as begun</hi> (which you still insist on) then how can <hi>James</hi> prove by Works many years after, that the Faith was fruitful, when he was first justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Indeed the words you cite, undeniably prove that <hi>James</hi> and you speak not of one and the same Justification, or of Justification in the same sense. For you speak of it as <hi>begun,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> speaks of it only as <hi>continued</hi> (Legal Justification I mean) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performance of that Obedience which is the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61305:280"/> secondary part of the Condition; and so he includeth also the Evangelical Justification, which I before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, as being the necessary <hi>medium</hi> for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and continuation of the Legal. It is beyond doubt that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified long before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up his Son. And this Work could be no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Justification which was past; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>James</hi> speaks not of that. And indeed how else could <hi>James</hi>'s Doctrine be reconciled with <hi>Paul's,</hi> or the truth, if it spoke of the <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Justification?</hi> For that is before and without the very presence of all <hi>external Works:</hi> (you think, <hi>before love to Christ;</hi> and say, <hi>All our Divines so hold:</hi> and yet here you say, that Protestants generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that Faith which is <hi>without Works</hi> to justifie: But so do not I; therefore I give less to Works than you think Protestants do.) Except you will say (as <hi>Grotius</hi> doth, and I think in this truly) that <hi>James</hi> by Works means, <hi>a disposition and resolution to obey,</hi> as <hi>still necessary</hi> (implied in the taking Christ for King,) <hi>and actual obedience when we are called to it.</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> did not offer his son in Sacrifice, but by <hi>attempting</hi> it, and chearfully addressing himself to it, shewed his resolution to obey.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As for <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. which you urge, there is no necessity of your sense, nor is it much against what I say, if it be yielded. Either you think <hi>James</hi> by <hi>[Fulfilled]</hi> means, <hi>quoad sensum verborum ut primo sunt enunciata:</hi> (But that cannot be, because they were Historical, and therefore fulfilled as soon as spoken; and not Prophetical, to be fulfilled after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:) Or else he useth the word <hi>Fulfilled</hi> less strictly, as referring to the Doctrine which that Historical Enunciation did contain, viz. <hi>[That it</hi>

And then the sense may be, 1. Either by way of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;</hi> q. d. <hi>[In this sense is this Scripture-Doctrine fulfilled,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, that is, He believed and obeyed also:]</hi> Or it may be by way of <hi>Concession;</hi> q. d. <hi>[Yet the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith,</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>believed,</hi> &amp;c.

                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. For your Interpretation of <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. it is only your Affirmation, and is as easily denied. Sure I am, that my Interpretation is true <hi>quoad Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="8">8. Your own Interpretation and Mr. <hi>Pembles,</hi> granteth as much as I plead for, I think, if you contradict not your self again: If by <hi>[Works,]</hi> you understand <hi>[a working-Faith,]</hi> it shall suffice me, if you apply it as <hi>James</hi> doth; that is, not to a mere <hi>necessitas praesentiae</hi> of Works, but to that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibility</hi> to the effect, which <hi>James</hi> gives to both: Or (to speak as others) not only to <hi>Faith in it self,</hi> but to Faith <hi>as working.</hi> If <hi>[a working Faith]</hi> be made by God <hi>the Condition</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> then the <hi>modus</hi> or adjunct, <hi>[Working,]</hi> is a true, necessary, secondary part of the <hi>Condition,</hi> as the <hi>Faith</hi> it self is the substance or principal part. As when God makes <hi>[sincere Faith]</hi> the <hi>Condition, Sincerity</hi> is thereby made the <hi>modus,</hi> and so far a true part of the <hi>Condition.</hi> If you bargain to give me <hi>[a sound, swift, travelling Horse]</hi> on such a price: You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your money for him as really <hi>quatenus sound, swift,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>quatenus a Horse.</hi> If a Woman in Marriage covenant to be <hi>[a faithful Wife,]</hi> (and <hi>not adulterous)</hi> she receives her interest in the Man and his Estate primarily <hi>quatenus a Wife,</hi> but also <hi>quatenus faithful;</hi> for want of which she may be divorced after. In this sense therefore I will not contend against you, if you yield, that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Condition</hi> of continued and consummate Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not only considered <hi>in se</hi> as <hi>Faith,</hi> but also as <hi>working.</hi> But still I say, I had rather stick to the Scripture-words, when I see no necessity to change them.</p>
                        <p>But now if Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> or you, or any, will say, <hi>[Works justifie not the Person, but the Faith,]</hi> you
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61305:282"/> say and unsay. It is a contradiction: For if it be true in all particular causes, that <hi>Justificatio causae est etiam Justificatio personae</hi> (as <hi>Bradshaw</hi> tells you more fully, <hi>de Justif. Edit. Lat.</hi> c. 3. §. 9, 10. p. 30.) much more in such a Justification as this, which Everlasting Life dependeth on. If you be accused to be a final <hi>non-</hi>performer of the Conditions of the New-Covenant, he that justifieth your <hi>performance,</hi> justifieth <hi>you</hi> against <hi>that Accusation,</hi> and hath no other way to justifie you. This Accusation is, 1. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that you are <hi>an open Infidel:</hi> Against this you must be justified, by producing <hi>your Faith it self.</hi> 2. Or that you are a <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> that is, a <hi>close Ʋnbeliever:</hi> And so you must be justified <hi>coram Deo,</hi> by pleading the <hi>sincerity</hi> of your Faith, and <hi>coram hominibus conjecturaliter,</hi> by producing <hi>Works</hi> as the fruits. 3. Or that you are but a <hi>half-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> or <hi>half-Performer</hi> of the <hi>Conditions;</hi> viz. One that took Christ for your own ends to save you, but not to <hi>rule you,</hi> (Luke 19. 27.) or that believed (in <hi>James</hi>'s sense) but did not <hi>obey:</hi> Against this you must be justified by producing your <hi>consent</hi> to <hi>Christ's Rule,</hi> and your <hi>Obedience.</hi> (And to this <hi>James</hi> had respect.) Or, 4. You are accused to be an <hi>Apostate:</hi> And against this you must be justified, by producing your <hi>Perseverance.</hi> So that whatever part of the Condition you are accused to have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, you must be justified, by proving the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that part. And this is <hi>Justificatio personae &amp; non tantum causae.</hi> Nay, when you say, <hi>[Works justifie our Faith,]</hi> you plainly grant also, that they <hi>justifie our Person,</hi> when the case is, <hi>[Whether we are true Believers or not?]</hi> There is no way in this case (which will be the great case at the day of

He speaks of <hi>Works,</hi> as <hi>Competitors with Christ;</hi> and not as <hi>subordinate to him. (James</hi> contrarily.) For the Question that <hi>Paul</hi> debates is, Whether we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined by the Works of the Law, or by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ received by Faith? Where he principally in his Question opposeth <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as in point of <hi>Merit;</hi> and Faith is but colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally put in the opposition. 4. He speaks against
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61305:283"/>
                           <hi>Works justifying meritoriously,</hi> and not as <hi>Conditions</hi> of the <hi>continuance</hi> of a free-given Righteousness. This I could bring multitudes of our Divines that affirm, that the Apostle speaking against <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Works,</hi> means in point of <hi>Merit;</hi> and that this is the Controversie between us and the Papists. 5. He doth so usually add, <hi>[The Works of the Law]</hi> as if he had foreseen this Controversie, and of purpose let them know, that it is not <hi>Obedience to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> that he <hi>excludes</hi> from justifying as a <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in subordination to Christ; but Works done in Opposition, Competition or Co-ordination with Christ. 6. He expresly speaketh only of those Works which make the <hi>Reward to be of Debt, and not of Grace,</hi> and of no other. So much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be premised.</p>
                        <p>Now particularly to your first Argument, I say, 1. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Gospel-works cannot</hi> be set in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Christ's Righteousness,</hi> that is against their nature; and therefore could not so justifie: Which is all <hi>Paul</hi> says. But yet they might justifie as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions under Christ.</hi> 2. Your Conclusion unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is expresly against the words of Scripture, <hi>James</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                        <p>To your second I answer, 1. There is no such words as yours, <hi>[of what kind soever,]</hi> either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or intimated by <hi>Paul.</hi> To <hi>him that worketh,</hi> in the sense <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of (that is, <hi>ut operarius,</hi> to have the wages for the worth of the work) <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is not of Grace, but of Debt.</hi> 2. Else you fully do feign it, to contradict the whole scope of the Scripture, that promiseth the Reward to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. For the Apostle there speaketh of <hi>[Working,]</hi> and not only trusting in them; and he speaketh of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61305:284"/> the <hi>[Reward]</hi> and not only of <hi>Justification</hi> only. And do you think, that every man that obeyeth Christ, yea that obeyeth <hi>praemii gratia,</hi> doth make the Reward to be not of Grace? Then <note place="margin">☞</note> fair fall Antinomians and Rebels. 3. Faith is as truly a <hi>Work,</hi> as <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it is not by <hi>Paul</hi> excluded; therefore not all <hi>Works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have followed this so far with another Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brother, that I will say the less of it now. The two too common Answers are, 1. That this is <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> Answer; which I think not worthy a Reply. 2. That Faith justifies not as a Work, but as an Instrument. And so I say (more truly) Love, Hope, sincere Obedience, justifie not as Works, but as the Conditions on which God hath given the Confirmation, Continuation and Consummation of Justification. There is a third Answer of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, that <hi>credere</hi> is not <hi>agere,</hi> but <hi>Pati:</hi> But I think I have confuted that sufficiently.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To your third I say, 1. That plainly shews that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks only of the Justification I first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. 2. We have need of pardon for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Faith, Love, and every Work; therefore we have need to be justified <hi>coram Deo Legislatore Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis operum,</hi> by <hi>Remission of sins</hi> through the <hi>Sacrifice of Christ:</hi> This is all your words will conclude, or <hi>Paul</hi> intends; and this is easily granted, and I hope should be faithfully maintained against any Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, if there were occasion.

                        <p n="3">3.

                        <p> In <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. he urgeth the Application, <hi>Seest thou not how Faith wrought with his Works;</hi> i. e. He both believed and obeyed, his Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience did co-work; or (if you will, that his Faith produced Works) and <hi>[by Works was Faith made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;] (i. e.</hi> by those Works which it produced, or he added, Faith was made perfect for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of its ends, to which else it was dead, as is oft said before: Perfect and Dead are opposed; Dead is insufficient to the ends.)</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In <hi>vers.</hi> 23. he for preventing an Objection, <hi>[Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>justified by Faith?]</hi> interpreteth that saying, <hi>[The Scripture was fulfilled which saith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(q. d.</hi> He was indeed justified by Faith, the Scripture is fulfilled in that: But when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Works,</hi> it was not then by <hi>Faith alone,</hi> but by <hi>Faith and Works</hi> added (for though <hi>Faith</hi> be the <hi>Condition of Initiation,</hi> yet <hi>Faith and Obedience,</hi> of the <hi>Confirmation, Continuation</hi> and <hi>Consummation</hi> of Righteousness.)</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. He very solemnly calls them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Question concluded from this Argument, <hi>[You see then how that by Works a man is justified, and not by Faith only:]</hi> Not by that <hi>Faith</hi> only which <hi>did work;</hi> but by <hi>Works</hi> (as he had oft said before) <hi>not Works</hi> necessary <hi>as signs,</hi> or as <hi>idle Concomitants,</hi> but <hi>[by Works he was justified:]</hi> And lest we should doubt whether he only require their presence, and not their conditional interest, he shews their interest to be of the same nature, though not of the same order and degree as Faith's interest is, by applying the word <hi>[By]</hi> to the several members <hi>[By Works, and not only by Faith:]</hi> And puts <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>solum,</hi> lest if he had put it <hi>adjectively,</hi> it might occasion the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61305:286"/> Interpretation. And he saith not, <hi>[Faith is justified,]</hi> but <hi>[a man is justified.]</hi> So that they that say he speaks of the Justification of <hi>Faith,</hi> must make it run thus, <hi>[You see that by Works a mans Faith is justified, and not by Faith only.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. His fifth Argument he urgeth from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Rahab. Rahab</hi> was justified <hi>by Works</hi> (still retaining and inculcating the same words of being <hi>justified by Works,</hi> and not only by <hi>the Faith</hi> which produceth them; lest if he speak it but <hi>once,</hi> we might think it were not his <hi>proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And so expresseth the <hi>particular Work</hi> by which the Scripture commendeth <hi>Rahab,</hi> as being one of those Works that justifie her.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And so he concludeth again, <hi>Vers.</hi> 26. That as the <hi>Body without the Spirit, so Faith</hi> (i. e. <hi>A sound Orthodox Belief:</hi> For so our Divines against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Commentators usually interpret it) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works</hi> (to second it, and joyn with it, as part of the Condition of continued Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) is <hi>dead also (i. e.</hi> is <hi>unprofitable.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have laid by all Authors, and the remembrance of their judgments, as much as I could, and looked only on the words of the Text, and charged my Conscience to speak what seemed the true unforced Analysis: And this is it that seems to me to be the naked sense. But when I had done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed the sense of Expositors, I see no reason to change it.</p>
                        <p>Now if (as I have said) <hi>Piscator, Pemble,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>[working Faith,]</hi> mean not only <hi>[Faith it self as Faith,]</hi> but <hi>[Faith as working,]</hi> i. e. <hi>first as Faith, and secondarily as Working,</hi> they say as much as I (but yet I will not accuse or refuse this oft repeated

                        <p n="1">1. I confess you have me now at a disadvantage. I shall not easily rid my hands of this Platonick Argument, though the Logick of it may be well enough dealt with. If I say that <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. knew not so much as I, it will seem Arrogancy: If I say they did know more in this, I seem to confess my self to err. But what if I speak freely what I think without dissembling, let it seem what it will? I think for the service <hi>Calvin</hi> and such others did the Church, and for the progress that Truth made by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61305:287"/> their endeavours, it was such, that I deserve not to be named the same day with them: I think also that <hi>Calvin</hi> brought in more New-Doctrines (new to those times) than I have done incomparably: I think also that he writes so moderately oft of this very point, that I think his judgment was in sense, in the main, the same with mine. Yet I think his apprehensions of the Doctrines now in dispute, and his expressions of them, were not so clear, distinct and orderly, but that some that come after may see further, and redress those oversights, which have occasioned quarrels since (when, as Dr. <hi>Stoughton</hi> saith, <hi>We differ but in words about Justification by Faith, not understanding each others meaning. Form of wholesom words.)</hi> And I will not be so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, for fear of seeming arrogant, as not to speak plainly, that I hope God hath shewed me somewhat further in this point, and some others, than <hi>Calvin</hi> hath taught or discovered. (And yet I think few of his <hi>nearer</hi> followers saw so much as he; but <hi>most</hi> depraved his Doctrine by out-going him, while they thought they did but imitate or vindicate him.) I hope when the Master-workman hath built the House, his Boy may say, without the imputation of Arrogancy, I have driven two or three pins which my Master oversaw.</p>
                        <p>But if this free Answer will not serve, I will answer as I have learned: I also will ask of you a Question or two. And when you have answered me, I will answer you.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Do you think that neither <hi>Clem. Roman. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clem. Alexand. Tatianus, Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Cyril,</hi> &amp;c. nor any one Divine for a thousand
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61305:288"/> years after <hi>Paul,</hi> did understand his Doctrine, or know how Faith justified, or how far Works did concur? And you cannot but know (that are a man of reading) that they give generally as much, and mostly more to Works than ever I did, and that they teach our Justification by Faith to be as by Condition, and not as by an Instrument (whatever forced scraps some may gather out of a line, against the full scope of the whole page or Book.)</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Do you think that <hi>Calvin, Martyr, Chamier,</hi> &amp;c. with the stream of great renowned Forreign Divines (specially the first Reformers) did none of them know <hi>what justifying Faith was?</hi> that which we think our Children should know by their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism? which we think is so near the foundation? And yet did these men take justifying Faith to be either <hi>Assurance</hi> or <hi>Perswasion</hi> of the <hi>pardon of a mans own sins in particular;</hi> and say, He that had not this <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Perswasion,</hi> had no Faith; and even lay a mighty part of Doctrinal Reformation, and difference between us and the Papists in this? And yet almost all our English Divines (except An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians) and most others, do now generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that Doctrine as erroneous, and place justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith in Affiance, Recumbency, Assent or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> confessing that <hi>Assurance,</hi> yea, and that <hi>perswasion,</hi> to be a separable fruit. Was it the former or the present Divines that knew not what justifying Faith is? Indeed if this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were good, you might save all your other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments through your whole Animadversions, and carry all with this one Question: [Do you think I understand not the nature and use of Faith in Justification?] For I reverence your
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61305:288"/> understanding as much as some of theirs at least.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But your next words indeed concern the heart of our Controversie; and if I mistake not, do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the main part of your mistake, and withal do contradict themselves.</p>
                        <p>You grant that Faith is a <hi>Condition,</hi> and (elswhere) that it justifieth <hi>as a Condition;</hi> yet you say, it Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth, as it <hi>apprehendeth Christ's Satisfaction,</hi> by which indeed so apprehended, we are justified. But,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If by <hi>[Apprehending,]</hi> you mean <hi>[Acceptance,]</hi> and not mere <hi>Assent</hi> to the truth of the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing Christ's Satisfaction, I then say, that this is a very great mistake: For it is <hi>Christ himself,</hi> and not his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> that is the <hi>adequate Object</hi> of the <hi>compleat act</hi> of <hi>justifying Faith,</hi> that is, the <hi>Wills act:</hi> It is <hi>Christ himself</hi> that is <hi>offered to us</hi> to be our <hi>Head, Husband, Lord, Saviour,</hi> and by <hi>accepting him,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> is made, and we are <hi>united to him:</hi> And this <hi>Ʋnion</hi> is the first effect of <hi>this Faith,</hi> and then <hi>Justification</hi> in order of nature follows as a <hi>benefit:</hi> As the Honours and Dowry go with the person in Marriage. Not that there needs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other act of Faith to <hi>justifie us,</hi> after that the first hath <hi>united us</hi> to Christ. No: It is one act of Faith which is <hi>uniting, justifying, adopting,</hi> &amp;c. they are several <hi>relative effects</hi> resulting from the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-grant,</hi> upon our <hi>first believing</hi> (which is the <hi>Condition.)</hi> It is to <hi>God</hi> that Christ's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is <hi>given,</hi> and to us <hi>Christ himself,</hi> and the <hi>fruits</hi> of it: It is too gross a conceit, that only the <hi>apprehension</hi> of Satisfaction it self, or <hi>Righteousness</hi> either, should be the <hi>justifying Act:</hi> As if you should say, <hi>A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans apprehension</hi> of her <hi>Husbands Riches,</hi> is it that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61305:289"/> makes her <hi>rich,</hi> when it is her <hi>Consent</hi> to have the <hi>man.</hi> And a dangerous Doctrine this is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our sensual people, who are contented to have <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> (as you speak) or <hi>Righteousness,</hi> but not himself in the state he is offered: This turns mens thoughts from Christ himself, with whom they must first close in Marriage-Covenant, before they shall have any Righteousness by his Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You seem to conceive that Faith justifieth <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Physico, &amp; non Politico vel Morali:</hi> That as a man that takes money in his hand, doth thereby <hi>physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally receive</hi> it, so he that takes Christ's Satisfaction or Righteousness, doth physically receive it. Which is too gross. For, 1. The Question is of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Right,</hi> and not <hi>Possession:</hi> And no <hi>physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Apprehension</hi> as such, gives <hi>Right.</hi> 2. <hi>Recipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re est pati, sed credere est agere; ergo credere est tantum reoeptio imputativa.</hi> 3. Christ's <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or Righteousness is not an Object capable of our physical Reception. 4. Yet a <hi>physical Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> there is, imperfectly called so, even as all <hi>Relations</hi> are <hi>received;</hi> and which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Justificari,</hi> Passive Justification: But this follows Faith. <hi>Gredere &amp; Justificari non sunt idem: Credimus enim ad Justificationem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Controversie between us must lie here: Whether the <hi>formalis vel proxima ratio</hi> of Faith's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in our Justification, be its <hi>Apprehensive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>its Office of Conditionality?</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith it self? or that it is the <hi>Condition</hi> to which the free Donor hath annexed Justification? For <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendere Christum</hi> I confess to be the <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith. Now I say (and say more confidently than ever, having tried the strength of many against it)
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61305:289"/> that <hi>Apprehendere vel Acceptare Christum</hi> being <hi>ipsa sidei essentia,</hi> is but the <hi>matter</hi> that hath interest, and not the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of <hi>Faith's interest</hi> in our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> It is but the <hi>aptitudo ad officium,</hi> and the <hi>Conditionality</hi> (if I may so call it) is the <hi>Office</hi> it self. <hi>That Faith</hi> which doth <hi>accept Christ,</hi> doth justifie, and <hi>materialiter thereby:</hi> But not <hi>as it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth Christ.</hi> The word <hi>[As, quatenus]</hi> should strictly speak only the <hi>formal Reason:</hi> And so Faith justifieth only as <hi>a Condition,</hi> appointed thereto by God. But if any should extend it improperly to the <hi>ratio aptitudinalis,</hi> then I would yield to them, that Faith justifies as it accepteth Christ.

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith it self (which is <hi>acceptare Christum)</hi> goes in order of Nature <hi>before</hi> its <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality:</hi> It is therefore apparent, that the act is but the <hi>materia apta,</hi> and the <hi>Conditionality</hi> is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded <hi>formalis ratio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. If <hi>Faith as Faith,</hi> justifie, that is, as <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Christi,</hi> then <hi>omnis acceptatio, &amp; sola, &amp; semper;</hi> then the Consequence would proceed directly and necessarily <hi>ex se [I have accepted Christ, therefore I am justified:]</hi> But that it will not do. For, 1. He is ours, as <hi>given</hi> directly; that is, the efficient cause of our right to him. Had we taken him, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that same act which we call Apprehension without <hi>Gift,</hi> it had conveyed no right. 2. And (if you say, that, at least, <hi>omnis apprehensio Christi dati</hi> doth justifie <hi>qua apprehensio;)</hi> I must add, That if Christ had been given by an <hi>absolute Promise</hi> or <hi>Gift,</hi> our apprehension of him would not have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; but we should have been justified <hi>before</hi> it,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61305:290"/> or <hi>without</hi> it. As if a man by Testament give his Lands to his Son that is a thousand miles distant, and knows nothing of it, the right is his before his knowledg or consent, though he may afterward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess himself of it when he will. If a King will confer any Honour on a man absent, or an Infant, he may do it, and they partake of the Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own knowledg or consent. And when they do <hi>know</hi> and <hi>consent,</hi> that gives not the Honour or Title which they had before. If God had pleased to say, [I will give my Son and his Righteousness to such <hi>Infants, Ideots, Indians,</hi> though they never hear of him; or absolutely to say, <hi>[I will pardon all their sins,]</hi> they had been justified and pardoned thereby without Faith: If the Promise were not <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> (expresly or implicitely) no mans Faith could justifie him. As it belongeth to the <hi>Legislator per praeceptum constituere Debitum officii,</hi> and without Precept (natural or superadded) duty, would be no duty: So it belongs to the <hi>Legislator</hi> or <hi>Donor,</hi> as <hi>Dominus praemii</hi> (and in our case <hi>Dominus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miati)</hi> to institute the <hi>Conditions</hi> on which it shall be obtained; and therefore it is not from the <hi>essential nature</hi> of the <hi>act of Faith</hi> it self. The benefit to be received was wholly God's before the giving; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be conveyed any way, but by the mere signification of God's will: What way is then to alienate a Propriety freely, or to confer right to a benefit on another, but by signifying the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors will? that is, by giving, selling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now therefore no act of ours can confer to us the right to anothers benefits; that were to give them to our selves before we have them. All that our act can do, is to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Gift; that is, an
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61305:290"/> act which it pleaseth the Donor so to require of us, if we will have his Gift, that he will suspend his Donation thereon; so that when we perform it, we shall have it, and not without it. Seeing therefore that the Will of the Donor as Donor, doth all in Alienation of his own, or in conveying right to his benefits; therefore no act of the Receivers as an act, or such an act directly, can do it: For from his Will must the Receivers act have its most immediate formal interest: Now the <hi>Natura fidei apprehensiva,</hi> is not from God as <hi>Legislator</hi> of the <hi>New-Law</hi> or <hi>Testament,</hi> and as <hi>Donor of Christ</hi> and <hi>Justification;</hi> but from God as <hi>Creator</hi> or <hi>Producer</hi> of that <hi>Act in the Soul,</hi> or by it. But the constituting the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is <hi>God's act as Donor</hi> of that very <hi>Benefit,</hi> or as <hi>Legislator.</hi> That which I mainly therefore insist on is this: Call Faith an Instrument, or an Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or what you will, as long as you mean but the <hi>nature of the Act or Habit,</hi> it doth not <hi>justifie proprie &amp; proxime qua talis,</hi> that is, but the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria apta;</hi> but the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of its justifying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, is <hi>quá conditio foederis:</hi> And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is such a Condition of Justification doth justifie.</p>
                        <p>One while the Condition was not the same as now it is, and yet it then justified. The World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ was not bound to believe that this Jesus was the Christ, that he was born of a Virgin, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead, buried, risen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only that Christ who should come, should do thus (and it may seem that the Disciples before Christ's Resurrection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not that neither:) But if we believe not that this Jesus is he, we shall die in our sins. Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore justifie <hi>proximè &amp; formaliter ex natura</hi>
                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:61305:291"/>
                           <hi>actus,</hi> when it hath been so changed; and yet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was the Condition, still justified.</p>
                        <p>Besides, you contradict this your self, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that Faith justifieth <hi>as a Condition</hi> of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> For then certainly it cannot justifie <hi>proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè,</hi> as it is <hi>apprehensio,</hi> that is, <hi>qua fides.</hi> For, 1. The <hi>Conditionality</hi> cannot be the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of the Act, the super-added <hi>form,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For the <hi>Conditionality</hi> supposeth the <hi>nature</hi> of the Act, and not, the nature of the Act supposes it to be the Condition. 2. It is not possible that both should be <hi>proximae vel formalis rationes:</hi> It must be but one. 3. It is impossible, if Faith be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> but that it should justifie <hi>quâ conditio;</hi> and it is impossible, if it justifie <hi>as a Condition,</hi> but that should be its nearest Reason. To say, [the Sun is <hi>causa efficiens</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and yet that it produceth not Light <hi>qua causa efficiens,</hi> or yet that there is some nearer Reason; were not so absurd as to say, <hi>Faith is a Condition,</hi> and yet either justifieth not <hi>quâ conditio,</hi> or yet hath some more formal Reason. But I have by so many Arguments lately to another Brother, confuted this Opinion, [that Faith justifies <hi>ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura actus,</hi> viz. <hi>ut apprehensio Christi, vel ut fides, &amp; ut conditio naturalis, &amp; non ut conditio moralis]</hi> that I must now thus dismiss it.</p>
                        <p>If you say, that you do not mean, that <hi>Faith as Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>h,</hi> or <hi>ex natura actus</hi> justifieth, but <hi>ex natura objecti.</hi> I answer, 1. Our Question is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ justifie? if that be it, we are agreed: I do not think when you say, Faith is an Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Christ,</hi> or a <hi>Condition,</hi> that you mean [Christ <hi>justifies as an Apprehension of Christ, or a Condition:]</hi> The Question is therefore of <hi>Faith's</hi> interest, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61305:291"/> not of <hi>Christ's.</hi> 2. The Object gives not a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force to the act. 3. The root still of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes lieth, in having thoughts of this moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Right, as if it were a physical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of some Substance or Quality. The receiving of fire burns my hand <hi>ex naturâ objecti,</hi> and my act of Approximation, or taking it into my hand, is <hi>conditio naturalis (impropriè dicta condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio:)</hi> But in conveying Rights (as in Marriage, Testaments, and all Contracts, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> the <hi>Right</hi> must be first conveyed by <hi>moral means,</hi> before the <hi>Object</hi> can put forth its power. Christ is not yours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is Christ, nor yours because you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him (speaking of the nearest Reason;) but yours, because God hath <hi>given him;</hi> and yours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>believing,</hi> rather than on any other terms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath given him to you, <hi>if you believe,</hi> rather than on other terms. If God had said, some other act should be the Condition, it should have justified, as truly Faith now doth.</p>
                        <p>And therefore for your Argument, <hi>[Works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not with Faith in apprehinding; therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in justifying.]</hi> I deny your Consequence, having first denied your ground: For, <hi>sides non quà fides justificat, sed quà conditio praestita.</hi> And I argue contrarily, Repentance and Obedience to the Lord that bought us, do concur with Faith in being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of continued and consummate Justification, therefore they concur in justifying. (Yet I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say, <hi>[We are justified by Faith,]</hi> as signifying only a Conditionality, and being a Scripture-phase; than that <hi>[Faith justifieth,]</hi> as importing more a <hi>Causality,</hi> and being no <hi>Scripture-phrase.)</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. No wonder: for it is brought to another end, than to prove that by Works, is meant Works.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What will you take for proof? If I should find the most express words for it, I think they may have another sense put on them as fairly as these.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I think the proof lieth on your part (which I see not performed:) For if I shew you where the Scripture saith, <hi>[We are justified by Works, and not by Faith only:]</hi> If you say, by <hi>Works</hi> is not meant <hi>Works,</hi> you must prove it. Because the plain sense is not to be forsaken without <hi>cause;</hi> and therefore he that doth it, must shew good cause for it.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="237" facs="tcp:61305:292"/> 4. But yet I will tell you what goes with me for proof (that by Works is meant <hi>Works,</hi> and not only the <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>doth work)</hi> till I hear better proof of the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>James</hi> calls them by the name of <hi>[Works] twelve times</hi> in thirteen Verses, and never by the name of <hi>[working Faith,]</hi> or, <hi>[that Faith which worketh:]</hi> A repetition not usual in Scripture, specially on such a subject: As if he had purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done it to make men believe, that he means as he speaks; and therefore I think by <hi>[Works]</hi> he means <hi>[Works.]</hi> For obscure figurative speeches are usually but seldom, in comparison of the plain ones, and sufficiently evinced to be such by the more plain.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I am yet the more perswaded, that by <hi>[Works]</hi> is meant <hi>[Works,]</hi> brcause it is still op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>[Faith without Works,]</hi> or, <hi>[Faith alone,]</hi> and not to <hi>[this or that sort of Faith, viz.</hi> that Faith which is not of a quality to Work,] though I doubt not but that is part of the Apostle's sense, in this term <hi>[Faith,]</hi> yet it is but part: For it is not only <hi>[the Faith alone, without a working disposition,]</hi> but <hi>[Faith alone without Works themselves,]</hi> when there is opportunity: The word <hi>[Alone]</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Works themselves, as well as the <hi>working dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> So that if I will wrest the word <hi>[Works]</hi> twelve times together to a strange sense, I must needs use the same violence with the word <hi>[Faith alone]</hi> also. Should I again run over each Verse, it is easie to manifest, that the opposition is not only between <hi>[a Faith disposed to Work,</hi> and a <hi>Faith not disposed;]</hi> but between <hi>[Faith alone,]</hi> and <hi>[Faith and Works themselves together:]</hi> Though yet the <hi>conatus</hi>
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:61305:293"/> is the <hi>work,</hi> where no more is required, as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s case.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Particularly the Argument <hi>à simili,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. proves it: For the Argument is, <hi>As merciful words do not profit the naked and hungry without clothes and food, so a good Belief will not justifie and save you, without Works.</hi> Now it is not a <hi>disposition</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>clothe</hi> that profiteth the hungry and naked: So neither is it a mere <hi>disposition</hi> to work, that is meant by Works.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The same is manifest in <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. where the occasion of all this discourse is begun, in the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of mercy, such mercy as men partake of from us.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. I am the more confirmed, when I consider, that the death of Faith without Works here, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 14, 26, 24. is not merely the hypocrisie or seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it: (He likeneth it to the real Faith of the Devils,) but the <hi>inutility</hi> of it as to justifie and save; (for justifying and saving Faith are all one with <hi>James,</hi> vers. 14, 21, 24.)</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. by <hi>[Works]</hi> must needs be meant <hi>[Works;]</hi> else it would run thus, <hi>[Thou hast Faith undisposed to Work, and I have a working Faith: Shew me thy non-working Faith without thy working Faith, and I will shew thee my working Faith by my working Faith.]</hi> I had rather understand <hi>James</hi> plainly, than take him to speak such non-sense: And if you will take <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> in the plain proper sense in this Verse, why not in the rest?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And in <hi>Vers.</hi> 20. <hi>Works</hi> must needs mean <hi>Works;</hi> else it must run thus, <hi>[Faith without a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is dead.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:61305:293"/> 8. And so must it be <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. else it must run thus, <hi>[Faith wrought with his working Faith, and by a working Faith was Faith made perfect,]</hi> nay, <hi>[a non-working Faith was made perfect.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. So <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. else it must be thus, <hi>[By a working Faith a man is justified, and not by a non-working Faith only:]</hi> As if a <hi>non-working</hi> Faith did partly justifie. (For I hope you will not turn <hi>solum</hi> to <hi>solam.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. So <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. according to your way it must run, <hi>[So a non-working Faith, without a working Faith is dead also.]</hi> Let him that can, receive this Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I cannot.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But my chief Argument lieth in the great necessity of Works which the Apostle asserteth, both to Justification and Salvation. Now if I meet with those that confess by <hi>Works</hi> is meant <hi>Works,</hi> I would desire to know the reason, Why Works with Faith are so necessary? If they do but by an idle Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy stand by, what means <hi>James</hi> to say, <hi>Can Faith save him? we are justified by Works: What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> &amp;c. So I would demand of you, concerning the <hi>working</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> If you understand <hi>[work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith,]</hi> so as to make <hi>Faith</hi> it self the primary part of the Condition, and <hi>working</hi> the secondary, then you yield all I desire: If you understand it so, as to confine it to <hi>[the Faith which worketh,]</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>[the Working]</hi> from justifying and saving (for <hi>James</hi> joyns both together) then will you open this mystery to me, and tell me, whence or what is this necessity that Faith should be working? If you say, <hi>Working is necessary to signifie Faith to be sincere.</hi> I reply, 1. But the Apostle makes it necessary to <hi>justifie</hi> and <hi>save,</hi> and not only to <hi>signifie.</hi> The
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61305:294"/> Soul doth not only <hi>signifie</hi> the Body to be alive.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God needs no signs, and it is he that judgeth. You will say, <hi>It is not sincere without working.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>real Faith,</hi> such as the Devils have, nay it may be more, they may really consent, that Christ shall justifie and save them from Hell.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How comes its Sincerity to lie in its working Disposition? The sincerity of Faith as a good Work, lieth in its conformity to the Precept: But that's not the Sincerity in question. The sincerity of Faith, as <hi>justifying</hi> and <hi>saving,</hi> lieth in its being really that Faith, to which as a Condition, Justification and Salvation are promised. Now if the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make not mere Faith, but <hi>Faith working,</hi> to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of Justification or Salvation, then Faith <hi>as</hi> working secondarily, must justifie and save. For if in any Covenant there be <hi>an Act</hi> with its <hi>Qualification</hi> required, as the <hi>Condition,</hi> then the <hi>Qualification</hi> is part of that <hi>Condition</hi> as well as the <hi>Act:</hi> For it hath the same <hi>essence</hi> herein. And to say, that working is part of the <hi>Condition</hi> of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation, and yet doth not <hi>justifie</hi> and <hi>save quà conditio,</hi> is a contradiction directly: As much as to say, It is a Condition, and not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for the form of the Condition, is in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive respect to the effect. As if you should say, [Such a thing is a cause efficient, but doth not <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61305:294"/> my reach to find any other respect wherein its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity should lie. Let them shew it that assert it.</p>
                        <p>As for them that say, It is but the <hi>Declaration</hi> of our Justification <hi>before men,</hi> that is here spoken of, and not <hi>before God;</hi> 1. I have said enough to them in that Aphorism. 2. I need not meddle with that to you, who own it not. 3. The same instances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> are produced, by which other Scriptures prove Justification by Faith before God. 4. The Justification here meant, is an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Righteousness, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. and that is by God, and <hi>coram Deo.</hi> 5. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sacrificing his Son, would rather have <hi>condemned</hi> him <hi>before men.</hi> 6. It is such as the Scripture about Imputation was <hi>fulfilled</hi> in. 7. It is the same Justification as that by Faith is: For the Apostle saith, <hi>[It is by Works, and not by Faith only,]</hi> importing, it is <hi>by Faith,</hi> but not only by Faith. Now <hi>coram hominibus</hi> it is not by Faith it self at all (indeed by the <hi>profession</hi> of Faith it may be.) 8. The Apostle makes Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works unprofitable <hi>to save,</hi> vers. 14. And is it before men, or by men only, that they <hi>are saved?</hi> 9. Men know not when we <hi>work</hi> from <hi>sincere Faith,</hi> and when not. 10. Men be none of our <hi>Judges,</hi> nor doth the Apostle discourse of so small a matter as our being judged by man: And yet this is the commonest Exposition. Thus I have told you, why I think by Works is meant <hi>Works:</hi> and why they justifie, and that <hi>coram Deo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now to Dr. <hi>Prestons</hi> saying, which I marvel that you could produce against your self so fully, and take no notice of it. Though I believe Dr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons</hi> Notions were not so digested as they should be in the point of Justification, yet they were so clear about
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61305:295"/> the nature of <hi>justifying Faith</hi> (above any man that I know of) that it hath maintained much sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Doctrine in the point of Justification in most things (only the notion of an <hi>Instrument</hi> was not then questioned:) and therefore if you go once to Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> I know where your cause is. It seems you could not pick one saying out of him seeming for you, but what saith almost as much against you as I do. 1. I say as he, that <hi>Faith alone justifieth,</hi> speaking of our <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>begun Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which makes a man <hi>justum ex injusto</hi> (that <hi>Works</hi> never do.) 2. I say <hi>Works follow Faith</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily. 3. This <hi>twofold Justification</hi> I maintain against you, which Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> here maintaineth. 4. In the common sense it may be said, that one is <hi>more fully Justificatio personae</hi> than the other: But then remember, 1. That both are yet most truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Justificationes personae,</hi> as <hi>Bradshaw</hi> shews in the place before-cited. 2. And that Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> confesseth it: For when he hath said, that one is <hi>[of the Faith,]</hi> he yet adds, <hi>[Works justified</hi> Abraham <hi>that he was no Hypocrite.] Sin</hi> is it that is enquired after at the Bar of <hi>the Law:</hi> Only <hi>one kind of sin</hi> is enquired after (as to <hi>Condemnation)</hi> at the Bar of the <hi>New-Law;</hi> that is, <hi>Ʋnbelief,</hi> or <hi>rejecting</hi> the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and recovering Grace. This <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> is either <hi>open</hi> (against the Accusation of this, men are justified by Faith and Profession; or <hi>secret</hi> (which is the Hypocrisie here mentioned) and against this Accusation both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> justifie: (Of which I spoke fullier before.) When <hi>Abraham</hi> is accused of being but a <hi>seeming</hi> Believer, or a <hi>mere Believer</hi> without <hi>Obedience;</hi> and so, either of <hi>not-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or but <hi>half-performing</hi> the Condition of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61305:295"/> New-Covenant: Here there is no way in the World to justifie him, but by his <hi>own Faith and Works.</hi> I shall speak more of this yet anon.</p>

                        <p>I will not forsake the plain sense of the Text, till other kind of Arguments than these constrain me. 1.

I wait therefore for some proof of your Consequence, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Justification twenty years after his Conversion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by Works as part of the Condition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, because his Justification was begun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works. 3.

                        <p n="1">1. Here (methinks) you yield the whole Cause. For if we be first justified by Faith alone, then Works do not concur with Faith to procure our Justification, seeing it is procured already by Faith alone without Works.</p>

                        <p>If this Concession will make us one, I think I shall never recall it. But it is a strange yielding of the Cause.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Works do not concur to procure that first change, which makes us <hi>justos ex injustis:</hi> Doth it follow that therefore they concur not as Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that <hi>continued Moral</hi> act of God by his <hi>Covenant,</hi> by which he doth truly justifie us every day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If that be a good Reason, then no <hi>act of Faith</hi> through our lives doth justifie us, but the <hi>first act:</hi> for every <hi>after-act</hi> findeth us justified. But that this is false, I prove 1. <hi>Ad hominem:</hi> You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it in the next lines, that our Justification is continued by the <hi>Continuance</hi> of Faith; and that <hi>Continuance</hi> is as truly <hi>justifying</hi> as the first. Which is fully proved. 2. In that the act of Faith, which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61305:300"/> the Scripture saith was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness, was not his first act. Nor that of <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moses,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. I take this for plain proof. 3. The sum of all your mistake is your Assertion, that <hi>[As our Justification is begun, so it is continued,]</hi> which meaning of the <hi>Condition</hi> is far from truth. It is <hi>continued</hi> by the same <hi>God, Christ, Merit, Covenant:</hi> But not by the same <hi>condition</hi> only. 1. Your next words contradict this: For the first act of Faith (which you say <hi>begins</hi> it) and the <hi>contiuuance</hi> (that is, the renewed acts; for the <hi>same act</hi> continueth not) is not all one. But if you mean <hi>specifically,</hi> though not <hi>numerically</hi> the same; that's not so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. I have proved out of many Scriptures, that <hi>[forgiving others,] Repentance</hi> of after-sins, <hi>praying</hi> for Pardon, sincere Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are by God made conditions of Continuance. 3. And (that it may not seem strange) it is usually so in almost all conveyance of Right by Contracts. There is more put in the Contract as the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Right,</hi> than of <hi>first possessing</hi> it. Marriage, Consent or Contract on the Womans part, is all the Condition of her first right to her Husband, and his Honours and Estate: But Fidelity, Love, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection (specially of the Church to Christ, who is also absolute Lord) is also part of the Condition of Continuance. Your Servant shall have first right to the priviledges of a Servant in your Family up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare Contract; but it shall not be <hi>continued</hi> but on his faithful serving you. A Tenant hath <hi>first Right</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> on his Lease and Fine; but the <hi>Continuance</hi> is on Condition that he also pay his <hi>Rent.</hi> The Subject hath the priviledges of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61305:300"/> on his <hi>engaging</hi> to the Sovereign Power; but the <hi>Continuance</hi> is on his <hi>fidelity</hi> and actua obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws. And the Reason is, because in all these Covenants, there is besides the present <hi>Covenanting</hi> (which is all that's first required) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what promised and covenanted to be done for the future, that the benefits may be enjoyed. We co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to do something which must be done. In what sense soever <hi>James</hi> saith, Abraham <hi>was justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Works</hi> (supposing it <hi>coram Deo),</hi> I think his Justification was <hi>begun</hi> without them. This therefore I conceive to be the root of most of your mistakes in this point.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. I have fully told you what was wanting.

                        <p n="3">3. As <hi>Bradshaw</hi> well saith, Christ satisfied not for all that we should perform to the Law, but all that we should perform, and did not; (that is, for our sins) except this Condition of the New-Covenant.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61305:302"/> with a New-Sanction (as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body from the Earth) and so imposed as of indispensible necessity, and the final neglect of it excepted from pardon. And so when-ever you call it [the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,] and deny the performance to be a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in sense of that Law, you contradict your self.

                           <hi>Paul</hi> doth absolutely exclude <hi>Works</hi> from Justification, as I proved before. Though sometimes he mentions the Works of the Law, yet not so as if by some <hi>other Works</hi> we might and should be justified. For indeed, <hi>all Works,</hi> if <hi>good,</hi> are Works of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> Works which the Law doth require: And to be justified by Works (of what sort soever) as <hi>Works,</hi> is to be justified by the <hi>Law.</hi> And therefore to the Righteousness which is of the Law, <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth the Righteousness which is of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. even as he opposeth Working to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. So that to be justified by the Law, and to be justified by Works (any Works, whatsoever they be) is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61305:304"/> one and the same thing, and contradistinct to being justified by Faith or Believing. Though therefore believing be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet we are not justified by believing, as it is working, so as to rest in that Work, as a Work for Justification: But we are justified by believing, in that thereby we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Righteousness of Christ, which is the only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness whereby we are justified.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is most sure, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not exclude that fulfilling of the Gospel-Conditions, that we may have part in Christ; <hi>viz.</hi> that so in Christ we may have Righteousness, and by that Righteousness may be justified; which by any Righteousness of out own, out of Christ, we cannot be. <hi>Paul</hi> so excludes Works, that he <hi>sets</hi> up Faith; and he so sets up Faith, that he sets up Christ, as him by whose Righteousness, through Faith imputed to us, we are justified. By him all that believe are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. And so much you acknowledg presently after, saying, [Paul <hi>doth by the word</hi> Faith] <hi>especially direct your thoughts to Christ believed in. For to be justified by Christ, and to be justified by receiving Christ, is with him all one.</hi>

                        <p>Some of these places prove, that justifying Faith must shew it self by the fruit of sincere Obedience, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 25, 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12, 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. Some of them shew, that Repentance and turning to God is required as Antecedent to Justification, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. But this turning to God is by Faith; and without Faith all Repentance is vain and unprofitable, as that of <hi>Judas</hi> was. To the same purpose is that, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 22. where together with Repentance, is joyned Prayer; but it must be the prayer of Faith, <hi>James</hi> 5. 15. So that still it is Faith that doth all in point of Justification. That <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Arise and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord,</hi> imports only (I think) thus much, that by being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Paul</hi> was to have the washing away of his sins confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; for he was already a Believer, and so his sins through faith in Christ's blood were washed away: His Baptism there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was only to confirm this to him, and to assure him more fully of it. What 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 22. &amp; 4. 18. are to the matter in hand, I cannot see: Perhaps these places are misprinted.</p>

As the solemnizing of a King's Coronation, or a Mayors or Bailiffs Instalment in his Office, by taking his Oath, is not the Confirmation of that which before was compleated, but the compleating of that which before was incompleat; so is Faith of the <hi>heart</hi> without <hi>solemn Baptismal Covenanting</hi>

But why say you not so of <hi>Justification</hi> also, nor yet give a Reason of the difference? If we were <hi>justified</hi> by the <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> then it would be derogatory to Christ's Righteousness: But we are not justified by the merit of it; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. I would I knew what you mean by <hi>via Regni.</hi> Sure <hi>via</hi> is more than an Antecedent. And if a <hi>means,</hi> you should tell us, what it is less than a <hi>Condition.</hi> 3.

                        <p n="1">1. An <hi>inchoate and imperfect</hi> Righteousness (as you call it; and truly <hi>quoad materiam remotam)</hi> is sufficient to justifie us against the Accusation of <hi>Not fulfilling</hi> of the <hi>Gospel-Conditions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Instead of discussing the sense of this Text, I will refer you to <hi>Ludov. de Dieu in loc.</hi> where also you shall find the same Doctrine that I deliver. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. proves fully, not only that Obedience is necessary to Salvation, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> but that it is a proper <hi>Condition</hi> of it, and necessary <hi>necessitate medii.</hi> I would you would have told me how it is necessary?</p>
                        <p>And here by the way, let me mind you of one thing, which I have not fully done yet: You make a great difference between the Condition of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and the Condition of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Indeed both have the <hi>same Condition,</hi> if you speak of <hi>right to Salvation,</hi> and of <hi>justifying</hi> that <hi>Right</hi> against all Accusers. (And as <hi>Reatus poenae</hi> is the most full proper <hi>Guilt,</hi> so this contrary Justification is the most full proper Justification.) When a man is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused</hi> to be <hi>Reus mortis,</hi> the Child of Death; he that proves him to be <hi>non-reum,</hi> doth thereby justifie him against that Accusation. Now that is proved, by proving him to have performed the <hi>Condition</hi> of Life, or not done that which <hi>Death</hi> is denounced against. This Text in hand saith, <hi>[If ye live after the flesh ye shall die: But if ye by the Spirit do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live.]</hi> Here is a a great part of the New-Law. Now if a man be accused as guilty of this <hi>Death,</hi> he that proveth that he lived not after the flesh, but mortified it, doth most properly <hi>justifie</hi> him. And yet here is
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61305:310"/> no talk of Justification or pardon of sin in the Text: What of that? The same Covenant promiseth or giveth <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to Salvation on the <hi>same Conditions;</hi> but more frequently mentioneth <hi>Salvation,</hi> as containing all other benefits: But certainly he that against an Accuser proves a man's interest in a <hi>promise of Salvation,</hi> doth <hi>eo nomine</hi> justifie that man, though that Promise mention not <hi>Justification.</hi> Our first <hi>accepting Christ</hi> for Lord and Saviour (supposing <hi>our taking God</hi> for our <hi>only God,</hi> and <hi>chief Good)</hi> doth give us an <hi>immediate right</hi> to <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> and if then we died, we should be saved. But our obeying Christ, and confiding in him as a Lord and Saviour (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Covenant) doth <hi>continue</hi> (as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) our right to <hi>both</hi> Justification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It seems to me an ungrounded fancy (such as Divines have spun many of, to perplex poor Souls and themselves, going the Schoolmens way of add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their devised conceits, even while they blame them) to make <hi>one thing</hi> (the single act of <hi>Faith only)</hi> to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>Glorification.</hi> And yet (to deal freely with you) I meet with none more guilty of this than you. For you discern, that the ordinary Doctrine of Faith's justifying as an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is not exact or proper, and therefore you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be the <hi>sole Condition</hi> of <hi>Justification.</hi> Whereas other Divines tell me, that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> are both <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Justification</hi> (and in that are like) but <hi>Faith</hi> only is the <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Justification:</hi> (And in that they differ.)</p>

                        <p n="1">1. As to my purpose, it is of no great moment in which sense we take: For if Christ did receive the Sacrament of his Supper, it is certain it was but that his example, joyned to his words, might be the <hi>Institution,</hi> and not to <hi>the ends</hi> that we take it; no more than he was <hi>baptized</hi> for <hi>incorporation into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, burying with himself, remission of sins,</hi> &amp;c. which are our ends.</p>

                        <p>There is not the like Reason of Justification and Salvation: For Salvation is wrought by degrees; it's begun here, and perfected hereafter.

                        <p n="1">1. As one good act may <hi>cause another in our selves,</hi> so there is not the <hi>same Reason</hi> between Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that part of Salvation. For that is but the <hi>Condition</hi> of one, which is the <hi>Cause</hi> of the other.

                        <p n="2">2. I have said enough to this. <hi>[Freedom]</hi> is here ambiguous: Either you mean active Liberation, or passive: If the latter, either you mean a certainty, that we shall not be condemned; or you mean, <hi>non-Condemnation</hi> at present; or you mean <hi>right to Absolution per judicem;</hi> or else <hi>Absolution passive it self.</hi> The Reprobate here are <hi>non-condemnati per sententiam judicis,</hi> though <hi>per Legem</hi> they are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already.</hi> The <hi>Elect</hi> from the foundations of the World were sure <hi>(certitudine objecti)</hi> to be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved;</hi> yet were not then freed perfectly. <hi>Right to Absolution</hi> is perfect <hi>pro praesenti in se,</hi> as is the <hi>right</hi> of a Tenant in his house, when he hath taken his Lease; But it is not perfect <hi>pro tempore futuro:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, 1. More Conditions are to be performed. 2. More sins to be pardoned. If you mean it of <hi>actual judicial Absolution,</hi> you are not so perfectly freed in this Life.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Where there is not the <hi>active Absolution,</hi> there is not the passive: But the <hi>active Absolution judicial per sententiam,</hi> either is not at all in this life, or is not perfect, therefore, <hi>&amp;c. Apologetical</hi> Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath degrees: And <hi>Sentential</hi> is the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect kind.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Justification is opposite to Condemnation: But <hi>Condemnation</hi> is not perfect (if properly any at all) till the Judgment; therefore Justification is not perfect till then. <hi>Condemnatio Legis est tantum virtualis, ut respicit judicium.</hi>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61305:319"/> your self, or you mean no such <hi>Moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> but that a man may be saved without it. Nay, you say, that men are <hi>first justified</hi> by taking Christ as <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> take him for King: And so a <hi>Christ-dividing Faith,</hi> which is <hi>no true Faith,</hi> should justifie, and the taking him as King should not be necessary <hi>ne quoad praesentiam.</hi> And when you have taught wicked men, that it justifieth them to accept of Christ as Priest, to justifie and save them, and they <hi>are willing of that</hi> unfeignedly, will you make them believe they are <hi>unjustified again,</hi> because the accepting Christ as King doth not follow it? Or will you shew them why they are not justified, when neither Cause nor Condition is wanting? What an effect is that which will not be produced, when there is all the Causes and Conditions?</p>
                        <p>Why is it that <hi>accepting Christ as King</hi> must of <hi>necessity</hi> follow? All <hi>necessity</hi> hath <hi>some Reason.</hi> And if you would perswade either them or me, that they do <hi>not accept</hi> of Christ's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie</hi> them (which you say is the Condition) and that they do but dissemble, neither they nor I can believe you. <hi>They feel</hi> the contrary, and <hi>I know it.</hi> I never knew man in my life that was unwilling to be pardoned and justified, or willing to be damned.

                        <p>[Spiritual] for [special] was a misprinting; a thing very frequent in that Book. 1. You might perceive that I speak not of the difficulty of <hi>assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth</hi> of Christ's <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> but of the <hi>Wills Consent</hi> or <hi>Acceptance,</hi> supposing the <hi>Assent.</hi> It is as difficult for the <hi>Ʋnderstanding to believe Christ's Priestly Office,</hi> as his <hi>Kingly:</hi> The Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved neither. I never met with a Papist, but would say, He trusted only in the Merits of Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be not generally at this day, so bad in this as they are made. <hi>Rivet</hi> saith (and so do many more of our Divines, citing the same passage, as <hi>Ames.</hi> &amp;c.) that the Jesuites themselves admit, <hi>Rectam esse nostram sententiam, si intelligamus nobis imputari Christi merita, quia nobis donata sunt, &amp;</hi>

And <hi>Rivet</hi> adds, <hi>[Quae certe nostra est ex parte sententia, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aliam nobis affingat de justitia Christi tanquam causa formali.</hi> Riv. Disp. 10. de fide Justif. §. 13. p. 190. And <hi>Vignerius</hi> and other Papists ordinarily say, that <hi>Man's Works are not necessary to supply any defect in Christ's Satisfaction (for it is perfect) but only for the application of it to our selves.</hi> And how many of them deny <hi>Merit,</hi> in sense, you know: Yet I excuse none of their errours.</p>
                        <p>But that which I speak of is the compleat act of <hi>justifying Faith in the Will:</hi> When men <hi>believe</hi> Christ to be the <hi>Mediator,</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> (which wicked men may do, seeing the Devils do it) it is not then so hard a matter to make them <hi>willing</hi> to take him for their <hi>Justifier,</hi> as to take him for their <hi>Ruler.</hi> I know there is in man a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Pride, by which he would be beholden to none. But when men are convinced that they are sinners, and they cannot pardon themselves▪ nor any save them but Christ; I think it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make them willing that Christ should pardon and save them. I say again, <hi>No man can be willing to be damned</hi> or <hi>unpardoned,</hi> that knows these. I know never a wicked man about me, but is willing to be pardoned and savd by Christ.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. I yield to your first from Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> (as to those acts that are not essential;) but have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that the <hi>Qualification</hi> of Faith is <hi>part of the Condition,</hi> and so it hath the <hi>necessity-moral</hi> of a <hi>Condition</hi> (as <hi>current English money</hi> in a Bond:) And not only a <hi>natural necessity</hi> (as it is necessary an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire man have <hi>two hands,</hi> &amp;c.)

                        <p n="4">4. That which mars all your discourse is, 1.

                        <p n="2">2.

                           <hi>Manton</hi> on <hi>James</hi> 2. 23. [For those great Disputes about the matter of Justification, I would not intermeddle, let it suffice to note, That the general current of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles carrieth it for the Righteousness of Christ; which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, maketh us just and acceptable b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that Faith justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the Popish sense, as a most perfect Grace, or as a good Work done by us; but in it's relation to Christ, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Christ's satisfactory Righteousness, And so whether you say it justifieth as an Instrument, a sole working Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or as an Ordinance or Relative Action required on our part, all is to the same issue and purpose. To contend about mere words, and bare forms of speech, is to be too precise and critical.</p>

                        <p>To Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> I say, 1. If it be all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we say, An Instrument, an Ordinance, or Relative Action required on our parts, then I much differ not from you: For I dare call it so, <hi>[A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Act required on our parts.]</hi> But,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I conceive that <hi>[A Relative Act]</hi> is a dark Expression: <hi>What Relation</hi> hath it to Christ? doth it justifie <hi>qua related</hi> to Christ? then why do not many other acts related to Christ justifie? For my part, I think, when the nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> and of <hi>Justification,</hi> and of a <hi>Condition,</hi> is well understood, it will appear that we have no proper name in use to express the <hi>Formalem Rationem</hi> of Faith's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Justification, but the term <hi>[Condition,]</hi> as it is used by Lawyers; or, <hi>Causa sine qua non, &amp; cum quâ, ex necessitate morali.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="308" facs="tcp:61305:328"/> 3. Do not those contend about words (and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking ones) that contend so much for Faith's <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentality</hi> in justifying? Words must be fitted to things. It is far from a mere contention about words, in the sense as I use it: Whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ only <hi>as Priest</hi> that <hi>justifieth?</hi> is a material Question; and so are many more that follow.</p>

                        <p> I came but even now from heaping up forty Testimonies of our Divines that speak as I, and am loth to do that work again, unless it were more useful: But I remember I promised you something of <hi>Davenant</hi>'s, because you oft mention him: And it is not any Sentences on the by, but his judgment fully and purposely delivered in Propositions, with their proof, how far Good-works are necessary.

                        <p>You may see here, if you will be of <hi>Davenant</hi>'s mind, you must be of mine in this: He gives to Works the very same Office as I do, neither more nor less. If he do give any more than I to <hi>Faith,</hi> (as he doth in calling it an <hi>Instrument;</hi> but I
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61305:329"/> think it is Metaphorically only that he means) that is all the difference. I undertake to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that our greatest Divines ordinarily give to Works as much as I: But indeed I give not to <hi>Faith</hi> (and to <hi>man)</hi> so much as they; not daring to make man his own Justifier and Pardoner, or his <hi>Act</hi> to be the <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>God's Act</hi> of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, or of producing the same effect. Who can forgive sins but God only? If he have any Instruments, it is his <hi>Gospel</hi> properly, and his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters remotely,</hi> and less properly.</p>

                  <p>TO the two Great Points in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, let me speak this word more:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Those that make Faith to justifie as an <hi>Instrument,</hi> or as <hi>Apprehensio Christi,</hi> do set up the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Credere</hi> which they cry down. For that which they call <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality,</hi> is the <hi>Apprehensive Act:</hi> And <hi>Apprehendere</hi> and <hi>Credere</hi> are here all one; and therefore if the <hi>Apprehension</hi> of Christ justifieth <hi>qua Apprehensio,</hi> or <hi>qua Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi> then the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Credere qua talis</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And those that teach this Doctrine, do contradict themselves in saying, that
<pb facs="tcp:61305:330"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> excludes <hi>all Works;</hi> because Faith (say they) justifieth not <hi>as a Work:</hi> For to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie <hi>qua Instrumentum vel qua Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio Christi,</hi> is to justifie as a <hi>Work,</hi> or as <hi>this Work.</hi> For they cannot speak <hi>de Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti materia:</hi> For, 1. Faith (the act) can be no <hi>material</hi> Instrument. 2. The whole formal nature of instrumental Cause, lieth in its actual Application by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cause: And before that Application it is only an Aptitudinal Instrument, or apt to be an Instrument; but is not one formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeed. Now the Causation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments is <hi>per Operationem vel Actionem:</hi> And therefore if Faith justifie as an <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cause,</hi> then it must needs justifie as <hi>Opus</hi> or <hi>Actio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And so this Doctrine sets up Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works, against which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors seem so zealous: (The unhappy fate of many Errours, to set up what they are the extream opposers of;) and that in an unlawful sense: For it makes the formal reason of Faith's justifying to be <hi>its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,</hi> that is, that it is <hi>such an Action;</hi> or its <hi>Instrumentality,</hi> which is <hi>an Operation.</hi> Whereas I only affirm (with Scripture) that
<pb facs="tcp:61305:330"/> Obedience to Christ justifies, not <hi>qua Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> or <hi>qua Opus,</hi> but as the <hi>Condition</hi> to which the free Lawgiver hath been pleased to annex Justification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Against yours (and the common) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, [That there is such a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>right to Salvation,</hi> that Faith alone procures one, and Works concur to the other.] Besides all that I have said, let me desire you to observe, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks as fully and directly of <hi>right to Salvation,</hi> as of <hi>Justification;</hi> and <hi>excludes Works</hi> as much (and more) from the one as from the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23, 24. <hi>Justification freely by Grace,</hi> is opposed to <hi>[coming short of the Glory of God.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly speaks of [the <hi>Reward given of Grace, and not of Debt;]</hi> and therefore excludeth those Works. But, 1. <hi>Savaltion</hi> is the <hi>Reward</hi> as well as <hi>Justification;</hi> and therefore this Reason equally excludeth Works from <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> as from <hi>justifying.</hi> 2. Yea, if their
<pb facs="tcp:61305:331"/> Doctrine were true, that say it is <hi>only Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and not <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Justification,</hi> that is given <hi>per modum premii,</hi> as a <hi>Reward,</hi> then this Text would not concern Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at all, but only <hi>Salvation.</hi> (But doubtless it doth concern Justification al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and therefore this is another good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Faith justifieth not <hi>qua In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentum vel Apprehensio, proxime, sed qua Conditio praestita,</hi> because Justification is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a Reward; and <hi>Rewards</hi> are given on <hi>Moral</hi> Considerations, and not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Physical.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: If they which be of the Law be Heirs, then Faith is made void,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, that the Promise might be sure to all the Seed,</hi> &amp;c. But doubtless this <hi>Promise</hi> is the <hi>Promise of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18. <hi>[Reigning in Life by Jesus Christ,]</hi> is opposed to <hi>Death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by</hi> Adam: And lest there should be any room left to doubting, he expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:61305:331"/> it, <hi>[Justification of Life.]</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Even so might Grace reign through Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> Vers. 9, 10. <hi>the Apostle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth</hi> Reconciliation <hi>and</hi> Salvation, <hi>and maketh the</hi> latter follow.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I know not how I omitted; perhaps because I thought <note place="margin">3. 9.</note> there was no need of expressing them. For however they must be understood; because God's Word and Truth is else ingaged in a Threatning as well as in a Promise. 2. You say, <hi>Append.</hi> p. 48. <hi>That the absolute promise of a New Heart is made to wicked Men:</hi> where you seem to speak of a Promise properly taken, as distinct from Prophesie or Prediction: Yet <hi>Aphor. p.</hi> 9. you say, That <hi>Absolute Promises are but meer Predictions;</hi> so that you seem not well reconciled to your self.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61305:339"/> you rather seem to restrain the word [Legislative] by the word [Preceptive], than to enlarge the word [Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive] by the word [Legislative]. 2. When you take the word [Legislative] largely, you make Precept and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise distinct parts of it: So that still it is strange to me that you should say; <hi>That Promises fall under the Will of Purpose, not of Precept.</hi> For if the Will of Precept be taken strictly and properly, it is superstuous to say, That Promises do not fall under the Will of Precept: Neither on the other side is it true, if the Will of Precept be taken largely and improperly, <hi>viz.</hi> for the whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Will, which doth contain both Precept and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>

For you say, <hi>That the Life promised in the First Covenant, was in the judgment of most Divines</hi> (to whom you incline) <hi>only the continuance of that Estate that</hi> Adam <hi>was in in Paradise:</hi> So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Opinion, <hi>Adam</hi> was both to have continued in the same place, and also in the same Estate. I think still, he should have been changed in respect of both. <hi>In</hi>

And if he were to continue in the same Estate, no question he was also to continue in the same Place; For Heaven is no place for such an Estate as <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradise.</p>
                  <p>I shall wonder if any will be so bold as to affirm, That <hi>Adam</hi> was Created <hi>in Patriâ,</hi> and not <hi>in Viâ.</hi> How <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> was he to be tryed by his Obedience, if he were not <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but <hi>Comprehensor?</hi> It seems also strange that any doubt should be made, whether <hi>Adam</hi> being Created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image and Likeness of God, were capable of Heavenly Blessedness.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons which I alleadged, notwithstanding any <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> thing you say against them, seem cogent. 1. By the Second Death, you might see, I meant not the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61305:340"/> yet the same kind of punishment. The Scripture seems to speak of several degrees of Hell-Torment, yet all is called the <hi>Second Death.</hi> And this Second Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Hell-Torment, <hi>Adam</hi> by his sin became liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: therefore if he had not sinned, he should have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a Life directly opposite to that Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Glory. The perpetual Death which <hi>Adam</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Saviour) should have suffered, was not a perpetual abiding in the Estate of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> a perpetual separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul and Body, or a meer privation of that Life he had before his Fall, but an enduring of eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and so consequently the Life promised upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Obedience, was not a perpetuating of his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, but the fruition of Heavenly Happiness. 2. I grant, God was able to change <hi>Adam</hi>'s State, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Place; but it seems rather, that both should have been changed. And though we know not the Nature of the Life to come, yet we know it is not such a Life as <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradise, to Eat, Drink, Marry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It is not in vain to say, How in an ordinary way of Providence should there have been room for Men upon Earth, if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity, still increasing and multiplying <hi>in infinitum,</hi> should there have continued for ever? Your Friend and mine Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> having ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.</note> this Argument, seems to enervate it when he hath done, saying, <hi>[But a thousand of these God can expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, when we are at a stand].</hi> But yet that without a Miracle it could be done, he doth not say, and he there professedly opposeth you in this Point. Whereas you add, <hi>[Especially seeing God knew there would be no place for such difficulties]</hi> I know not to what purpose it is. For the Opinion, which I impugn, doth suppose that upon which such difficulties do arise. 4. How should Paradise be a Type of Heaven, if Man should never have come to Heaven? If Heaven had not belonged unto him upon condition of his Obedience? Whereas you say, That <hi>you little know where or what that Paradise was;</hi> I do not well know what you mean. By [that Paradise] I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you understand (as I and others do) the Garden wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was placed: a place upon Earth for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it was, and very pleasant; yet such a place as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Adam</hi> lived a natural Life, far beneath that happiness which he was made capable of.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61305:340"/>
                  <p> Those words <hi>[Thou shalt die]</hi> being not only meant <note place="margin">

                     </note> of a privation of the Life which he then enjoyed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of eternal torment; it follows, That the Life implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promised, is to be understood, not only of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of that Life, but of Eternal Blessedness</p>
                  <p>I do not say that any now are altogether as <hi>Adam</hi> was <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> under the Covenant of Works; but that some are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Covenant, that <hi>in statu quo</hi> they have no part in the other Covenant, nor are guilty of contemning it, being utterly ignorant of it.</p>
                  <p>To whom God doth not say, <hi>[Believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>

                     <hi>Christ, and thou shalt be saved]</hi> to them in effect he doth say <hi>[Obey perfectly and live];</hi> or, <hi>[If thou sin, thou shalt die eternally].</hi> But there are many in the World to whom God doth not say <hi>[Believe,</hi> &amp;c.] that Promise is altogether unknown unto them, they live and die without ever hearing of it, so that to them it is as if it had never been. Consider (I pray) what the Apostle saith to this purpose, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. Might not the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have continued in that condition unto death? Do not many continue in the same Condition? I yeeld, that none are so under the Covenant of Works, but that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe they shall have Mercy, and that by vertue of the New Covenant: but that which I stand upon is this, That the Covenant of Grace wherein Mercy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, being not revealed unto some, nor any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed unto them, they cannot be said to be under it, nor shall be judged as transgressors of it.</p>
                  <p>Add, 1. Though the Covenant of Grace had never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> been, yet I see not but such Mercies as the <hi>Indians</hi> enjoy, (setting aside the possibility of partaking of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) might have been enjoyed. Add, 2. Though the Covenant of Works vouchsafeth no pardon of sin upon Repentance, yet surely it requiring perfect Obedience, consequently it also requireth Repentance and turning unto God. Else if the Covenant of Grace had not been made, Man after his Fall, though plunging himself into sin continually more and more, yet had contracted no more Guilt, nor incurred any greater Condemnation, than he did by his first Transgression. Add, 3. Christ as Mediator shall judge even those that never heard of any Salvation to be obtained by him; and consequently he will not judge them as guilty of neglecting that Salvation.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61305:341"/> Christ judgeth wicked Men as Rebellious Subjects; but as rebelling (I conceive) only against the Law, not against the Gospel, they being such as never were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it. Add, 4. There are common Mercies, (which might have been though the New-Covenant had not been) the abuse whereof is sufficient to condemn; yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them is not sufficient to save. If such Mercies as meer <hi>Pagans</hi> enjoy tend to their recovery, How then are such said to be <gap reason="foreign">

Yet Christ might observe the Law for some ends peculiar to himself, as for those ends he was made under it. Christ according to the flesh was a Jew, therefore meet it was he should observe the Jewish Law, otherwise he had been an offence unto them.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61305:342"/> 2. As Christ was not made Man for himself, so (it is true) he was not bound to observe the Law for himself. But thus you should not limit it to some Works; for all his Works were so for us, as he was <hi>nobis natus, nobis datus,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. Yet being made Man, as Man he was bound (I think) to perform that Obedience which God did require of Man. You say, That he used the Legal Ceremonies to shew his subjection: So say I; and this (I think) is against you, it being meant of such subjection as the Law required of all those that were under it. 3. If Christ were <hi>sub Lege,</hi> as the Apostle saith he was, then it was <hi>ex Lege</hi> that he observed those legal rites. Yet, I grant, it was <hi>ex vi sponsionis propriae;</hi> so all that he did, so his very being made Man was. Whereas you say, <hi>[Else the Law would have obliged him to the act and end together];</hi> I Answer, The Law doth oblige, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of the Law-giver, who might oblige Christ to it otherwise than he did others. I think the Ceremonial Observances, besides the Typical Nature of them, are to be considered as Religious Rites, whereby God was honoured and worshipped; and so Christ as Man was obliged unto them, Man being bound to honour and worship God, so as God doth require of him. That which you add of the burthen of Penal Actions, seems impertinent; For Penal Actions (I think) have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sufferings, and so they concern not the Point in Controversie betwixt us, which is only concerning Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Pious, not as Penal.</p>

He adds further, <hi>[Somewhat might be said for the subjection of the Humane Nature in Christ, the Manhood of Christ, which was a Creature, but the Person of Christ, God-Man, seems to be above subjection].</hi> This I confess seems strange to me; for the Humane Nature of Christ, though personally united to the Divine Nature, being still a Creature, must needs be in subjection to him that made it; and therefore the Person of Christ, God-Man, though not as God, but as Man, must be under subjection. He goes on saying, <hi>[We know the mortality of the Humane Nature, yet Christ had never died, unless he had made himself obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto death; neither needed to have served, unless he had humbled himself,</hi> Phil. 2. <hi>to take upon him the form of a Servant].</hi> But Mortality is no necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Humane Nature, as subjection unto God is; and Christ taking upon him the Nature of Man, did <hi>co nomine</hi> take upon him the form of a Servant; for Man must be Servant unto God, the Creature to the Creator. He bids, [See the <hi>Assemblies Confession of Faith,</hi> Chap. 8. Sect. 5. and Dr. <hi>Featlies</hi> Speeches upon it].

                        <hi>Ibid.

Though I am not of their mind, who think that the Son of God should have been incarnate, though Man had never sinned; yet I see no reason to doubt but so it might have been: Now <hi>hoc supposito,</hi> all Christ's meer Active Righteousness would have been due, but not his Passive Righteousness.</p>

If you had used the word <hi>[Chastisements],</hi> it would not have freed you from mine Animadversion. For I shew that Chastisements are Punishments. And whereas you speak of my great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, it is indeed your great mistake; for I did not take those words to express your Opinion, only you seemed therein to allow the distinction betwixt Afflictions of Love and Punishments; this is it which I thought worthy of an Animadversion.</p>

                  <p> You might see, that I make the Afflictions of God's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Children in their Nature to be Evil, and a Curse, though not so to them, they being sanctified and working for their good. And I presume, those Divines whom you oppose, meant as both you and I do, though you interpret them otherwise. The difference here betwixt you and me is this; You allow their Expression, and dislike their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I allow their Meaning, and dislike their Expression. They distinguish betwixt Chastisements and Punishments, which distinction in your <hi>Aphorisms</hi> you seem to allow, only disliking the Application of it. The distinction it self I dislike, though I think that some who used it, did not err in that which they intended in it. In the Contents of <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. there are these words, <hi>[God's Chastisements differ from Judgments],</hi> which words I hold incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I like not that of Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> against Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Chap. 4. p. 139. <hi>[Punishment aimeth chiefly at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Justice, Correction at the amendment of the Offender].</hi> That is not true of all Punishments, see <hi>Geld.</hi> Lib. 6. cap. 14.

                  <p>The Object of Love is not only present Good. There <note place="margin">

                  <p>Nay indeed, if Baptism be a Seal of remission of sins, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> then remission of sins (I think) is not the end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. For the thing must be, before it be sealed, <hi>i. e.</hi> confirmed. Though Baptism therefore be ordained to this end, to seal remission of sins, yet none can make this use of it, until they believe, and so have their sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Neither doth this make for <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> for Circumcision was of the same nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Yet were Infants circumcised. <hi>[Not all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>

Baptism is as well a Seal of Sanctification, as of Remission of Sins; for it seals the whole Covenant, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises contained in it. And as Circumcision signified and sealed the taking away of the Foreskin (or superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of naughtiness, as St. <hi>James</hi> speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 21.) of the Heart, so doth Baptism signifie &amp; seal the washing away of the filthiness, as well as of the guiltiness of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in one of his <hi>Diatribae,</hi> would have the thing signified in Baptism, to be only the sanctifying Grace of the Holy Ghost; wherein I cannot subscribe unto him. Whereas you speak of an External Covenant, as some call it; some may express themselves one way, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet all mean the same thing. For my part, I do not use to speak of an External Covenant, but of an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61305:347"/> External Being in the Covenant. which is all that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily we can be assured of in respect of others, and which is enough for admittance to the Sign and Seal of the Covenant. The People of the Jews, until by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed unbelief they fell away, were generally in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. even in that Covenant, which they that were Aliens from, had no hope, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. Yet many of them were but externally in the Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 27, 29. You labour in vain, when you seek to evade that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. How should any be actually Christs, except they be united to him? And how united, but by the Spirit? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. And if you meant (as you say) only of Saving Relations, Can a Saving Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be put upon any, and yet no Saving Work wrought in them? Neither truly is a meer profession such a real change, as I supposed you did mean, <hi>viz.</hi> a change of the Heart, whereby one is made a new Creature.</p>
                  <p>I think that properly there are not distinct Laws, from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> whose distinct condemnations we must be freed: That the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> 103.</note> Gospel doth not condemn any, but only leave some to <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Father (as I have said before) doth judg, though <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> by Christ, see <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. And however, I see not how <label type="milestone">

                  <p>If for every several Accusation there must be a several <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Righteousness, then there will be need of infinite Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses, <label type="milestone">

Indeed the Promise is made upon condition of believing, and therefore the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Condition, debars from benefit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. But this (I conceive) is not properly a new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, but only a making good of the former accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we having nothing to shew why it should not stand in force against us. Your self did well distinguish <hi>p.</hi> 22. betwixt a Condition as a Condition, and a Condition as a Duty. Now Faith as a Condition, is required in the Gospel, but as a Duty in the Law; For the Law requires
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61305:348"/> us in all things to obey God; that is comprehended in the first Precept, therefore it requires us to believe in Christ, God commanding it. Else not to believe, were no sin; <hi>for sin is a transgressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. Now as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is a Duty, so not-believing doth afford matter of Accusation, and cause of Condemnation: But as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is a Condition, so Net-believing doth only leave the Accusation otherwise made in force against us; and for sin, whereof we are accused and found guilty, leaves us to condemnation. Thus (I think) are those Texts to be understood, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>ult.</hi> Whereas you say, That <hi>the Accusation may be three-fold,</hi> truly in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may be manifold: But indeed the Accusation is but one and the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are <hi>Non-credentes:</hi> For <hi>Pagans</hi> do not so much as appear, and <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Solifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>are no Believers, as believing is a receiving of Christ, and that is the believing by which we are justified.</hi>

                     <hi>Solifidians</hi> do but appear to be Believers.</p>
                  <p>For the several Sentences from whence you argue; <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 1. You urged <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. to prove that God Creator judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <label type="milestone">

                  <p>That there is a sorer punishment, as of a distinct kind, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> than that Death threatned <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. you do not prove, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ad. </seg>5</label> neither (I presume) can it be proved. There are (I grant) several degrees of that Death, yet all of the same kind, <hi>viz.</hi> The loss of Heavenly Happiness, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of Hell-Torment. And if there must be a several Righteousness for every several degree of Punishment, there must be more Righteousnesses than you either do o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> can assign.</p>
                  <p>I say as before, I do not think this, <hi>[Thou art an Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> (I speak of Unbelief as a not-performing of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ad. </seg>6</label> Gospel-Condition) to be a new Accusation, but only a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61305:348"/> Plea why the former should stand good, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are sinners, and so to be condemned by the Law, because the benefit of the Gospel which we lay claim to, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto us, we not performing the condition to that end required of us.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say, <hi>[We are devolved to the New Law before our Justification is compleat].</hi> Are we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to it for the very beginning of our Justification? So again, <hi>[Christ's Satisfaction is imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the New Covenant gives the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest].</hi> Doth not the New Covenant give Christ also, in whom we have interest? I note these Passages, because your meaning in them perhaps is such as I do not sufficiently understand.</p>
                  <p>I say still, Here is no occasion properly of a new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but only of a <hi>removens prohibens,</hi> a taking away of that which would hinder the force of the former Accusation. And so there is no new Righteousness of ours required unto Justification, but only a Condition, without which we cannot have interest in Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that thereby we may be justified.</p>
                  <p>In your <hi>Aphorisms</hi> you speak only of a Two-fold Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> requisite unto Justification; now you speak of a Two-fold Justification necessary to be attained. But the Scripture speaks of Justification by Christ, and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, as of one and the same Justification, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Second Cause, (as you call it) <hi>viz. [Whether the</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
                     <hi>Defendant have performed the condition of the New Covenant]</hi> is indeed this, Whether he have any thing truly to alledge, why upon the former Accusation he should not be condemned? And so he must be justified indeed by producing his Faith, (and so his sincere Obedience to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his Faith) yet not as a new Righteousness of his own, but only as intitling him to Christ's Righteousness, as that whereby he must be justified.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you speak of a Three-fold Guilt, <hi>viz.</hi> [1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>culpae.</hi> 2. <hi>Reatus non praestitae Conditionis.</hi> 3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus poenae propter non praestitam conditionem].</hi> 1. As <hi>Omne malum est vel Culpae, vel Poenae,</hi> so <hi>omnis reatus</hi> seems to be so too. 2. The not-performing of a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Condition, brings no new guilt of Punishment, (if it did, surely it were <hi>Culpa,</hi> and so the second Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61305:349"/> falls in with the first) but only the loss of the Remedy, or Reward promised upon the performing of that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though the not performing of the Condition as a Duty, will bring a new guilt of Punishment. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Reatus poenae</hi> is not properly <hi>ob non praestitam Conditionem,</hi> but <hi>ob culpam admissam,</hi> which <hi>Reatus</hi> doth remain in force, because the Condition required for the removing of it, is not performed.</p>
                  <p>We must take heed of straining Law-terms too far in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Matters of Divinity. I see not how the firmness of my title to Christ's Righteousness for Justification, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called my Righteousness, whereby I am justified, though the firmness of that title may be questioned, and must be proved; yet if it prove false, it is not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly which doth condemn, (I speak of the Meritorious Cause of Condemnation) but sin committed against the Law, is that which doth put into a state of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for want of that Title, there is nothing to free from Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The Obligation unto Punishment is not dissolved by <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Satisfaction made by Christ, as to Unbelievers, because for want of Faith, the Satisfaction of Christ is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them.</p>
                  <p>1. For that far greater Punishment, which you speak <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of, I have said enough before. 2. Is that Non-liberation from former misery a distinct punishment from that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Though the former misery may be aggravated by neglect of that which would procure a liberation from it. If God had never made a New Covenant, there had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been a Non-liberation from that misery, which the breach of the first Covenant did bring upon us; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that misery they must lie for ever, who neglect the Remedies provided for them; and as their neglect doth aggravate their sin, so will it encrease their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Immunity doth result from the New Covenant, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Penality from the Old, unto which Unbelievers are left, the New Covenant affording them no Remedy by reason of their unbelief: and the Penality of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is accidentally increased by the New Covenant, in that by neglect of its Remedy sin is increased.</p>
                  <p>I am of this opinion, That the New Covenant hath no <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> other Penality, but that it doth leave Unbelievers to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61305:349"/> Penality of the Old Covenant, and by accident increase the same.</p>
                  <p>If that Penality be but the same Death, it hath no <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> more than the former; neither can that Act of Grace be properly said to appoint a new Punishment, but only to leave to the former Punishment, as not delivering from it. You speak indeed of Double Torments appointed by that Act for such as do reject it; but so (I think) the Similitude doth not hold. For I see not, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace doth so, but only (as I have said) leave some upon their not performing the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, to the Punishment appointed by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; which Punishment will be the sorer, as Sin by neglect of Grace offered is the greater.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though our Mediator do not believe, repent and <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> obey for us, but we our selves must believe, repent and obey, yet it doth not follow that our believing, repenting and obeying, is that Righteousness by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though we be not guilty of not performing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Condition of the New Covenant, yet this is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Righteousness, by which we are justified, though without it we cannot be justified, because not partake of Christ's Righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The rejecting of Christ may be considered; 1. As the receiving of Christ is a Duty Commanded. 2. As the receiving of Christ is the Condition of Pardon and Salvation offered. In the former respect, the rejecting of Christ is properly a sin, and so against the Law, though aggravated by the Gospel, in that Christ is rejected not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the benefit to be obtained by him. That the Law doth not speak of Christ, is nothing; for it speaks of obeying God in all his Commands, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly it speaks of receiving Christ, when God doth command it. In the latter respect the rejecting of Christ (I think) doth not properly bring a new guilt, but only continue and aggravate the former.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>recurrit questio,</hi> viz. Whether the New Law doth require the Condition as our Righteousness: it seems to me to require it only to that end, that Christ's Righteousness may be imputed unto us, and that so by that Righteousness we may be justified.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Faith, as a Duty, is a Conformity to the Law,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61305:350"/> though a partial and imperfect Conformity unto it, and so there's no being justified by it. As a Condition, it is a conformity to the Gospel, but no Righteousness by which we are justified, though a Condition upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of which we are justified by Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. The Condition being considered meerly as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not as a Duty, to object that we have not performed the Condition, is not to bring a new Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only to take away the Plea, why the old Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation should not prevail against us.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. That the Condition is not of so large extent as the Duty commanded, seems not to the purpose, the Question being of the Condition as a Condition, not as a Duty. Faith as a Duty (I grant) is part of our Personal Righteousness; but that is not it by which we are justified.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. As the Condition is a Condition, and no more, so the performing of it is no <hi>Justitia</hi> at all: as it is a Duty, so indeed the performing of it is <hi>Justitia particularis, &amp; secundum quid,</hi> as the performing of every Duty is: but such a <hi>justitia</hi> I dare not rely on for Justification. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say, <hi>That Christ's Righteousness is not simply our Ʋniversal Righteousness;</hi> it is true, if by [simply] you mean <hi>[absolutè, &amp; nullâ interpositâ conditione]</hi> otherwise our Universal Righteousness it is, so that we have no need of any other Righteousness for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though we have need of some thing to that end, that we may partake of Christ's Righteousness, and be justified by it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Gospel as distinct from the Law, doth shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> us our Remedy; the Law as distinct from the Gospel,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61305:350"/> doth prescribe unto us our Duty. Or if the Gospel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth prescribe unto us our Duty, yet no other Duty, though upon other terms than the Law doth prescribe. However, thought the performing of the Duty be in some sort our Righteousness, yet it is not that Righteousness by which we are justified. Still I distinguish of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving considered as a Duty, and considered as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As a Duty, it is our Righteousness, but not that whereby we are justified; as a Condition, it is that whereby we are justified, but not our Righteousness; it is only that whereby we receive Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteousness of Christ, that Righteousness indeed by which we are justified. Whereas you say, <hi>[The difference of the two Laws or Covenants, is the main ground which shews the necessity of a Two-fold Righteousness].</hi> The necessity of a Two-fold Righteousness is not denied, but only the necessity of a Two-fold Righteousness unto Justification.</p>
                  <p>This Two-fold Justification seems to be a new conceit. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I remember not that you spake any thing of it in your <hi>Aphorisms;</hi> neither (I think) will it easily be granted because of your Positions and Suppositions, but rather they will be rejected, as inferring that which is not to be admitted. For truly where the Gospel doth speak of more Justifications than one, (in that sence as we treat of Justification) I am yet to seek.</p>
                  <p>From a Two-fold Covenant you infer a Two-fold Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But is there a Two-fold Covenant, by which we are or may be justified? I conceive, we are justified only by the New Covenant. For <hi>by the Deeds of the Law</hi> (the Old Covenant) <hi>shall no flesh be justified,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. See also <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39.</p>
                  <p>1. To be accused as an Unbeliever, and a Rejecter of <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be accused as a sinner, and as one that did not continue in all things written in the Law to do them. For else Unbelief and rejecting of Christ were no sin; that Christ is not spoken of in the Law, is nothing, as I have shewed before. 2. That Accusation (that a Man is an Unbeliever, and a Rejecter of Christ) if it be made good, doth leave a Man to the Law, and makes all its Accusations to be in force against him, with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Sin for contempt of Mercy.</p>

                  <p>Again he saith, <hi>Obedientia non minus quàm ipsa (ex</hi>

                  <p>Again he saith, <hi>Cujuslibet Christiani, quicum actu</hi>

                  <p>Again he saith, <hi>Per justitiam Christi nobis imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>non possimus dici absolutè sive omni modo justi,</hi> &amp;c. He means, We are not freed from future Obedience, though we be freed from the guilt of Disobedience. This (except Libertines) none, I presume, will deny. But all this, as to the Controversie betwixt us about a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Righteousness requisite unto Justification, is (that I see) just nothing. But concerning <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> and the places which you point at in him, I observe, that §. 21. is twice so figured, and therefore which of the two you did intend, may be a question. I before noted what is in the former; but in the latter there is something, which peradventure you intended, though I judg it as little to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61305:352"/> your purpose as the rest. He saith, <hi>Nova Nostra Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia pro gradu suo, &amp; mensurâ, etiam justitia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra dicitur, quâ &amp; formaliter, inherenter, habituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sivè ex operibus justi (pro ipsius modulo) coram Deo etiam verè dicamur, utpote cujus ratione pro justis ex parte à Deo ipso censeamur, cujusque intuitu etiam in foro divino aliquo modo (si id opus esset) justificari possimus.</hi> But, 1. you see what mincing of the matter here is; <hi>[Pro gradu suo &amp; mensurâ: Pro ipsius modulo: ex parte: Aliquomodo: si id opus esset].</hi> This is not to the Point we have in hand, who speak of universal and entire Justification. 2. Here he makes against you; for he clearly makes Inherent Righteousness imperfect, <hi>[cujus ratione pro justis ex parte à Deo censemur]</hi> whereas you hold all Righteousness to be perfect, or none at all. What you mean by citing <hi>Wotton de Reconcil.</hi> part 1. lib. 2. cap. 18. I cannot imagine, for nothing do I there see for you, but much against you, though touching other Particulars in debate betwixt us. As in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter; <hi>Ex efficientibus Justificationis causis reliqua est Fides, quam Instrumenti locum obti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere diximus.</hi> And the title of the Chapter is, <hi>Quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Fides Causa Instrumentalis Justificationem Nostram operetur.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 100. he cites and approves that of <hi>Downam, Fides sola est, quae nobis jus tribuit ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Dei promissiones in Evangelio consequendas,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>pag.</hi> 103. that of our Church; <hi>Nihil ex hominis parte flagitatur ad ipsius justificationem, praeter veram &amp; vivam fidem.</hi> And immediately after he adds; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tamen haec Fides spem, dilectionem, timorem, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam excludere censenda est, quasi ad eum, qui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificandus est, non pertinerent, sed haec omnia ab officio justificandi (N.

The rest of the Chapter is taken up with those Reasons. Now what there is for your purpose, judg you.

Eandem justitiam esse viam ad vitam aeternam, cum in Lege, tum in Evangelio.</hi> But of a Two-fold Righteousness he there makes no mention; not (I say) of a Two-fold Righteousness required of us at all, much less required of us, that thereby we may be justified. He saith indeed, <hi>Quid enim si Lex Det in decalogo sit norma illius justitiae, quae et via Vitae Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae? Si praeter hanc in Lege praescripta sit alia via in Evangelio constituta, quid impediet, quo minùs justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficetur quisptam sine Legis implettone?</hi> He doth not mean, That the Righteousness prescribed in the Law, is one Righteousness, and the Righteousness constituted in the Gospel another Righteousness, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; but that we are justified only by this latter, and not at all by the other. He was far from thinking of your Legal and Evangelical Righteousness, as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing both necessary unto Justification: he only asserts Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteousness as necessary in that respect, which Righteousness he makes to consist meerly in remission of

Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after indeed he adds that which I cannot allow; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nec peccatum quidem Legis in Decalogo cancellis circumscribitur.</hi> This is not directly to the Point now in hand; yet because it may reflect upon it, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what we have about it afterward; I therefore think meet to note it by the way, and say, That if it be as he saith, then (it seemeth) St. <hi>John</hi> did not give us a full defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, when he said, <hi>Sin is a transgression of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4.</note>
                     <hi>Law;</hi> but of that more hereafter. <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Argument is of small force; <hi>Fides (inquit) in Christum crucifixum non praecipitur in Lege:</hi> but I have before him, shewed that it is otherwise. He himself presently after cites that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. <hi>[This is his Commandment, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> &amp;c.] Now the Law contained in the Decalogue, requires us to do whatsoever God commandeth; for if we do not so, we do not make him our only Lord God, as the Law requireth. That the Apostle doth oppose (as he saith) Faith to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. makes nothing for him. For Faith, as a Duty, is required in the Law, though as a Condition it be required only in the Gospel. Neither doth that advantage him, which he also objecteth, That the Law hath nothing to do with Christ as Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4. For though the Gospel only hold out Christ as Mediator to be believed in; yet Christ being so held out, the Law doth require us to believe in him. For the Law doth require a belief of every Truth that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, and a performance of every thing that God doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn. Now for <hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> If the Justification which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61305:354"/> he speaks of, <hi>Quâ ut sanctificati ac regeniti absolvimur à falsis Diaboli &amp; improborum criminationibus,</hi> be meant of some particular Acts, of which we are accused, it is but such a Justification as the Reprobates themselves may partake of, who may be accused of some things whereof they are not guilty. See <hi>Bradshaw de Justis. cap.</hi> 25. If it be meant of our estate in general, (as I suppose it is) then this is indeed no distinct Justification, but only a confirming of the other. For in vain do we pretend to be justified by Faith, (by which alone <hi>de Dieu</hi> grants we are justified) so as through Christ to be freely acquitted from the guilt of our sins, if yet we remain unregenerate and unsanctified. By the way I observe, That <hi>de Dieu</hi>'s words are against you, [Jacobus <hi>non agit de Justificatione, quae partim side, partim operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus peragatur].</hi> Thus much I had said in reference to this Author before I had him upon the Epistles; but now that I have him, I shall speak more fully to him, or to you of him, from that other place to which you remit me. <hi>viz.</hi> his Notes on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4.

                  <p>Thus then <hi>de Dieu</hi> in the Matter it self doth not differ from other Protestant-Writers, who generally hold, That the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, is that by which we are fully and perfectly justified; and yet we must also have Inherent Righteousness, which will justifie us in some sort, but not fully and perfectly, because it self is imperfect.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Placeus</hi> I have him not; but because you alledge his words, I will say something to him. He speaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of a Two-fold Accusation, and of a Two-fold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. But, 1. he seems to differ from me and others only <hi>modo loquendi.</hi> For he saith, <hi>Ab accusatione priore (qua sc. objicitur nos esse peccatores) sola fide justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camur; qua Christi gratiam &amp; justitiam amplectimur: à posteriore, (qua objicitur nos esse infideles) justificamur etiam operibus, quatenus its Fides (N.

To speak properly, they are not (I think) two distinct Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations. For to omit this, That to be <hi>Infideles,</hi> is to be <hi>Peccatores;</hi> and so the one Accusation doth include the other: To omit this (I say) the latter Accusation is but a re-inforcing of the former. Thou art a Sinner, saith the Accuser, and therefore to be condemned. Not so, saith the Party accused, for I am a Believer, and therefore justified. Hereupon the Accuser replies, Nay, it is not so as thou pretendest, thou art indeed no Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, therefore the guilt of thy sins is upon thee, and thou art under condemnation. All this is but one Accusation, prosecuted and confirmed against a Plea made against it. If they were distinct Accusations, then we might be freed from the one, and yet be condemned by the other: but it is here quite otherwise. For the force of the former Accusation doth depend upon the latter; neither are we freed from the former, except we be freed from the latter; whereas you seem to carry it so, as if we were first justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the former Accusation, and then were again to be justified from the latter: this seems to be the result of your Opinion.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61305:355"/>
                  <p> 1. Because I grant Faith to be required of us, that so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Christ's Righteousness may become ours, do I therefore make Faith it self to be our Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> that whereby we are fully justified. A part of Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness (I grant) Faith is, by which we may be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in some measure; but that is not the Justification here enquired of. 2. You should not put me to prove, That your Assertion is without Scripture; it is sufficient for me to say it, until you alledge Scripture for it. 3. Christ's Satisfaction is solely and wholly our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whereby we are justified from all Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though except we believe in him, we cannot enjoy that benefit by him; See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I confess indeed that there is more than Faith in the Condition of the New Covenant, but not as to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For that which you add, [James <hi>saith, We are justified by Works, and Christ by our Words];</hi> the question is not, Whether we be said to be justified by our Works or Words; but how and in what sense we are said to be so justified. There is a Particular Justification, and a Declarative Justification; thus we are justified by our Works and Words: but a full and formal Justification is only by Christ's Righteousness through Faith imputed unto us. 6. To say, That we are healed partly by the Medicine, and partly by the Application, I still think to be improper; neither do you bring any thing, whereby to shew the propriety of it. The Application of the Medicine is indeed requisite, yet it is the Medicine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that doth heal, though not except there be an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it. Common Speech is not always Proper Speech; neither can any that are acquainted with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and know how to distinguish between Proper and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Speeches, think it strange that there are improper Speeches found in Scripture. What will you say of those, <hi>[This is my Body] [The Rock was Christ]</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred such-like? For Rules of Logick, if you had made use of any, I might have considered of them. 7. May
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61305:356"/> not a Similitude illustrate, though there be such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as you speak of, betwixt that from which it is fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that to which it is applied? But why do you joyn Repentance and Obedience with Faith in point of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; I speaking only of Faith, and you as yet having said nothing for the joint interest of the other? 8. In your <hi>Aphorisms</hi> you plainly assert two distinct Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses, as requisite unto Justification; that there you make them subordinate, is more than I observe. but though Faith be subordinate unto Christ's Satisfaction in the matter of Justification, yet that we are justified by Faith as a distinct Righteousness, I cannot yeeld, no more than that the Application of a Medicine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a distinct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine by which one is healed. I am glad that you plainly disclaim a Coordination of Christ's Righteousness and Faith in the Work of Justification: But if they be but subordinate, then (me-thinks) they should not be two distinct Righteousnesses, by which we are justified. I see not how we can be justified (I speak of an Universal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, opposite to all condemnation, that which <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> calls <hi>Justificationem Vitae)</hi> both by the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">

You say, <hi>[A Man having a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and not applying it, may properly be said to die for want of Application];</hi> but to speak properly, I think, It is not the want of Application of the Medicine, but the Disease that doth kill the Man: So though a Man wanting Faith shall be condemned, yet take Faith meerly as a Condition, not as a Duty, it is not properly the want of Faith, but Sin that is the cause of his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; though his want of Faith may as aggravate his Sin, so increase his Condemnation.</p>

                        <hi>Ibid. Ib.</hi> 110.</note> as our Righteousness? You said a little before, <hi>[I do not think, that Christ's Righteousness of Satisfaction is that which the Law required];</hi> as if I said, That the Law did require it; whereas I meant only this, That the Law required Satisfaction, and Christ made it for us, so that Christ's Satisfaction serveth us instead of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which the Law required of us, and so may be called our Legal Righteousness. But the New Covenant doth hold out Christ's Righteousness to be apprehended by us, and made ours by Faith, that so thereby we may be justified. Where the Scripture speaks of a Two-fold Righteousness so as you do, or how this makes for the unfolding of the main Doctrine, or tends to heal our Breaches, I do not see: You affirm these things, but do not prove them. 2. What plain ground you laid down in your <hi>Aphorisms</hi> for that Two-fold Righteousness, I do not know: What I could observe any way Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, I was willing to examine, and so am still.</p>
                  <p>1. If it imply Blasphemy, to say, That Christ repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> and believed for us; Doth it follow that Faith or <note place="margin">21. 111.</note> Repentance is our Righteousness, by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Can nothing be required of us, and performed by us, but it must therefore be our Righteousness, and by it as our Righteousness we must be justified? 2. The Scriptures which I alledged, (viz. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 29. &amp; 10. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.) do sufficiently distinguish Faith from that Righteousness, whereby we are justified, and shew it to be only a means, whereby we partake of Christ's Righteousness, and so by that Righteousness of Christ are justified. The Argument (I think) is good, notwithstanding any thing you say unto it. Faith is only a means whereby Christ's Righteousness is imputed unto us unto Justification: Therefore it is not that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by which we are justified, <hi>Rivet</hi> speaking of the <note place="margin">

Comparative Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness I shewed to be but a less degree of Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but Ironical Righteousness is down-right Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, whereas a less Unrighteousness in comparison of a greater, is a kind of Righteousness. <hi>Minus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum respectu majoris habet rationem boni.</hi> 3.

For if you mean (as you seem to do) that we are not freed by it from the Punishment of the Old Covenant, but only from the Punishment of the New Covenant; 1. I know no Punishment of the New Covenant, but a leaving to the Punishment of the Old Covenant, with an aggravation of it for contempt of Mercy offered. 2.

Whereas you speak of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying against the Accusation of Non-performing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the New Covenant; I must still tell you, That taking the Condition meerly as a Condition, the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of non-performing it, is but a confirming a former Accusation of being guilty of the breach of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore to be condemned, as having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the New Covenant, the Condition of it being not performed. 3. If I do ill oppose the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereby we are justified, and the Righteousness whereby we are sanctified, as if the same thing might not be both; then welfare the Papists, who confound Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification. <hi>Duraeus</hi> the Jesuite, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">Duraeus Advers.

Indeed we cannot be so justified by the Law, as thereby to be freed from all condemnation; and this seems to be all that your Author here cited did mean, when he saith, <hi>Si non es Legem transgressus, Lege justificaris: si transgressus es, condemnaris.</hi> But this doth no more prove, That Righteousness must either be perfect, or it is none at all, (though indeed it is none as to absolute and universal Justification) than it doth prove, that there is no Holiness at all, except it be perfect. For doth not the Law require perfect Holiness as well as perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? And is not every transgression of the Law a privation of Holiness, as well as of Righteousness? How then can you admit an Imperfect Holiness to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and yet deny an Imperfect Righteousness to be Righteousness? And if our Inherent Righteousness (for of that we speak) must needs be perfect, if it be any at all, must not the same be said of our Holiness, this being a conformity to the Law as well as the other?</p>

If without any affectation or dissimulation of ours, we seem better than we are, it is another's errour, not our fault; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we therefore be called Hypocrites. Your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold distinctions of Sincerity do serve rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Reader, than to unfold the matter. I take sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to be no distinct Grace, but the <hi>Modus</hi> of other Graces: but why that <hi>Modus</hi> may not admit of degrees, I confess I do not see. I conceive Zeal to be of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet one may be more or less zealous, and so also more or less sincere. You say here, [There is no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium inter Ens &amp; non Ens]</hi> of which I make no doubt but <hi>pag.</hi> 2. you think Relations to be <hi>inter Ens &amp; Nihil;</hi> and what difference between <hi>Nihil &amp; non Ens?</hi> You say, That you have over and over shewed, That Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61305:364"/> to the Rule of the Condition, doth consist in <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibili.</hi> Indeed you have divers times affirmed, That all Conformity is of that nature, but I could never yet see it proved. But why do you now speak of Conformity to the Rule of the Condition? I take Conformity to the Rule of the Precept to be our Personal Righteousness, and the Sincerity of that Conformity to be the Sincerity of this Righteousness. And this Righteousness, though it be sincere, I hold to be imperfect, because the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Rule is imperfect. <hi>[Sincerity</hi> (saith Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Blake) is said to be the New Rule, or the Rule of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 111.</note>
                     <hi>the New Covenant. But this is no Rule, but our Duty, taking the Abstract for the Concrete; Sincerity for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere walking, and this according to the Rule of the Law, not to reach it, but in all parts to aim at it, and have respect unto it.</hi> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect to all thy Commandments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>And this is our Inherent Righteousness, which in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its Rule (N. B.) labours under many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections].</hi> And a little before he saith thus, <hi>[I know no other Rule but the Old Rule, the Rule of the Moral Law: that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, the only Rule].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It seems very incongruous to grant, that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>[Be holy still]</hi> doth import an encrease of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and yet to deny, that <hi>[Be righteous still]</hi> doth import an increase of Righteousness. For any thing I know, some on the contrary may as well say, That the latter words import an increase of Righteousness, and yet the other no increase of Holiness. Whereas you speak of varying the sense according to the variety of Subjects, you take it for granted, That here the Subjects are various; whereas both by this, and divers others pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before cited, it seems clear to me, that the Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> Righteousness and Holiness are really the same one with the other. For the <hi>Formale</hi> of Righteousness, what is it but Conformity to the Law, the only Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness? And why such Conformity may not be more or less, I am yet to learn. That place indeed, as many other, speaks of a true Personal Righteousness in the Saints, but yet not of a Perfect Righteousness in them; and consequently not of such a Righteousness, as whereby they are justified, except it be only in some sort, and in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61305:364"/> some measure, which is not the Justification about which we contend. This Imperfect Righteousness is measured by the Law of Works, as a Rule, though it be accepted only by the gracious condescension of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. you give many Answers, but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> seem but so many Evasions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I think there is no Question, but the Apostle speaks by way of Precept and Exhortation. <hi>q. d.</hi> If you have indeed learned Christ, and have been taught by him, you have learned to do so and so; therefore have a care to do so. Surely the Apostles words import a duty required, and so implicitly contain a Precept or Exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he speaks as well to Believers, True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as mere Professors, is as little to be doubted. For he speaks unto them upon a supposition, that they had learned Christ, and had been taught by him; which though it may belong to mere Professors, yet to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers much rather.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the New Man, which is created in Righteousness and Holiness, may encrease, as you grant, then surely Righteousness and Holiness, in which the New Man is created, and without which the New Man is nothing, must increased also. To say, That the New Man may increase in Holiness, but not in Righteousness, is for one that would say any thing, so that he may but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As well might it be said, That the New Man is created in Holiness, but not in Righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Form of Righteousness is Conformity to the Law, to which we must labour to conform still more and more, not only <hi>extensivè,</hi> but also <hi>intensivè.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The very conjunction of the words here, as in other places, shews that they are used as <gap reason="foreign">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, how we should give unto God the things that are God's, and to Men the things that are Mens, and not conform to the Law, which doth prescribe our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Men, I cannot see: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conformity to the Law, is the Righteousness now in question.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. For the accusation of <hi>Reatus poenae Novae Legis ob non praestitam Conditionem,</hi> it is no new Accusation, but a making good of a former Accusation; and so <hi>Reatus paenae Novae Legis,</hi> is but to be left <hi>in reatu poenae Veteris Légis;</hi> save that <hi>aggravatâ ex Evangelio culpâ ipsa eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am poena aggravatur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I confess, I was not before acquainted with these two Justifications which you speak of: I did not find them in your <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> but only two sorts of Righteousness as requisite to one and the same Justification, so I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it. But truly now that you open your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception more than before, I can see no solidity in it. We are justified by the Righteousness of Christ participated by Faith; but not by Faith, as being it self our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. Faith is indeed required unto Justification, yet not as our Righteousness, but as a Condition, Instra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Means (for I would not strive about words) whereby we partake of Christ's Righteousness. I see not, that the Scripture doth speak of such a Two-fold Justification, one by Christ and his Righteousness, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Faith as our Righteousness; but only of one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of Christ through Faith. <hi>By him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are justified,</hi> Acts 13. 39.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non-reatus poenae</hi> is not Inherent Righteousness, of <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which I expresly spake. I take it to be really the same with Holiness. What you cite therefore out of <hi>Gataker</hi>

                        <hi>(p.</hi> 47.)</note> and <hi>Placaeus,</hi> is nothing against me, I speaking of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in one sense, and they in another. Besides, you seem to mistake the meaning of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>'s words: for <hi>Sons</hi> is as much as <hi>reus culpae,</hi> and <hi>insons</hi> as much as <hi>non-reus culpae;</hi> whereas you seem to take <hi>Sons</hi> for <hi>Reus poenae,</hi> and <hi>Insons</hi> for <hi>Non-reus poenae;</hi> how-ever his words are not to our purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I see not how either here or elsewhere you infringe <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that, which I said about the Materiality and Formality, as well of Holiness as of Righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Holiness (you grant) is a Conformity to the Law, as it doth <hi>constituere debitum officii,</hi> so I conceive

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shall not deny, but that our Faith and Obedience <note place="margin">40, &amp; 41.</note> may be said to be justified from the accusation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness: Yet I think, That this is but a making good of our Justification against the Accusation of being Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For besides that the unsoundness of Faith (and so
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61305:367"/> of Obedience) is sin; besides this (I say) if our Faith be not sound, it is in vain, we are yet in our sins, we lie under the Curse and Condemnation of the Law, there being no freedom for us without Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I know none that say, Our Actions are justified through Christ's Merit by the Law of Works. For my part I should say, We and our Actions are justified from the Law of Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the condemnation of it, God for Christ's sake accepting us and our Actions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our imperfection, for which the Law, if we should be sentenced by it, would condemn us. But here by the way, let me observe this, That your retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what you said in your <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> doth seem to manifest thus much, That when you composed those <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> you either knew not, or liked not that Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Justification, which now you so often speak of, and somewhere say, That my ignorance in this Point is it, that doth mainly darken all my Discourse. That common saying is not always true, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>For my words; 1. I see not why those, <hi>[Acquitting us from all sin]</hi> should offend you. For you might see by what I there said, That I meant the not-imputing of any sin unto us. And so the Phrases used in Scripture, of God, <hi>not remembring our sins, his covering them, casting them behind his back, into the bottom of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. they all import such an acquitting of us from sin, as I intended; not as if God did account us to be without sin, which were false, but that God doth not charge sin upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> so as to exact satisfaction for sin from us. I meant the very same with Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in the words which you cited <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>Non hoc dicitur, Deum apud se judicare, illos pro quorum peccatis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis Christus satisfecit, nihil mali unquam commisisse, aut boni debiti omisisse; sed eodem habere loco quoad mortis reatum, &amp; jus ad vitam aeternam, ac si nihil vel mali admisissent, vel boni debiti omisissent.</hi> Thus Christ speaks to the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, and there is no spot in thee.</hi> What? may some say, Is there no spot in the Church? No, none in her, so as to be imputed to her. <hi>Sine maculâ deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quia culpa non imputatur,</hi> as one doth no less truly <note place="margin">Gilber. ad Loc.</note> than elegantly express it. You your self yeeld as much as I desire, or as my words import, <hi>viz.</hi> That God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitteth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61305:367"/> us from all sin, so as it induceth an obligation to punishment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you say, That to acquit us from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Old Law, is one Justification, and to justifie us against the accusation of being so obliged, is another Justification; I confess <hi>(Davus sum, non Oedipus)</hi> I do not well understand what you mean, for to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion these are one and the same. Me-thinks it must needs be, That what doth acquit us from the Obligation of the Old Law, doth also <hi>eo nomine</hi> justifie us against the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of being so obliged. For how are we acquitted from the Obligation, if not justified against the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being obliged?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I marvel why you should trouble your self with speaking of the sin against the Holy Ghost, and of final unbelief, when as you could not but know, that I spake of all sin, from which we may be justified. Why might not one as well quarrel with those words of the Apostle, Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all that believe are justified from all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I grant the New Covenant not to be violated but by final unbelief, yet (as I expresly added in that very place which you take hold on) so that this be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For the right understanding of it, I said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before; and for further explication, I refer you to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But in the next you do most strangely, even without any cause that I can see, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and (as they say) <hi>fluctus in simpulo excitare.</hi> That [first our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and then our Duties and Actions may properly be said to be justified, that is, accepted as just, and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all accusation brought against them, though in themselves they be not such, but that sin doth cleave unto them] why should this seem such horrid Doctrine, as that your Heart should detest it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I speak of good Actions: for it is absurd to say, That evil Actions are accepted as just, though we may be so accepted notwithstanding our evil Actions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I plainly say, That sin doth cleave to our good Actions; yet (I say) God doth accept them as just, notwithstanding the imperfection of them, and the sin that doth cleave unto them. If this be offensive to you, as well (I think) may you be offended at that <hi>Nehem.</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61305:368"/> 13. 22. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, concerning this, and spare me according to the greatness of thy Mercy.</hi> And so at that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>You also as lively stones are built up a Spiritual House, an Holy Priesthood, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable unto God through Jesus Christ.</hi> Neither is there any reason why those words <hi>[ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from all accusation brought against them]</hi> should distaste you. For what though an Accusation be true, if yet in some other respect it be of no force? May not they be properly said to be acquitted from all Accusation, who notwithstanding the Accusation, are freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? What matter is it how we are accused, so long as we are sure not to be condemned? Therefore the Apostle useth these Expressions as equipollent, <hi>[Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?]</hi> and <hi>[Who is he that condemneth?]</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. Might you not as vehemently fall upon those words of the Apostle, <hi>[Who shall lay any thing to the charge,</hi> &amp;c.] as you do upon mine? Might you not say, Why? I will lay this, and that, and that, and ten thousand things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to their charge? Yea, but when you have done all you can, to what purpose is it? <hi>For who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them, notwithstanding all the Accusations brought against them?</hi> These very words of the Apostle <note place="margin">

The Law doth convince of sin, and (as much as in it lies) condemn for sin, both us and our Actions, even the best of them: But by the New Covenant, Through Faith in Christ we are accepted as just, though guilty of manifold sins; and our Actions are accepted also, though full of imperfection. When you say, That the <hi>Reatus Culpae</hi> cannot possibly be removed, or remitted, though I think it is but a striving about words, which I do not love, yet

Of that Law I suppose St. <hi>John</hi> spake, saying, <hi>Sin is a transgression of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4. And St. <hi>Paul, By the Law is the knowledg of sin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20.

The first precept requires us to have the Lord, and him only, for our God; and so to believe whatsoever he doth reval unto us, and to perform whatsoever he doth require of us. The second Precept requires us to Worship God as he himself doth prescribe; and consequently not to neglect any of God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; See Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> of the Sabbath, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. §. 21, 22, 23.

Me-thinks then you should not make a Two-fold Righteousness, and a Two-fold Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; one in respect of the Old Law, another in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the New. The Precept <hi>[believe]</hi> belongs to the Old Law; but as it is not only a Precept, but also a Condition, upon performance of which Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, <hi>[Believe; and thou shalt be saved]</hi> so it belong; to the New Law. So this Threatning <hi>[If thou dost not believe, thou shalt perish]</hi> belongs to the Old Law, as threatning death for every sin, and consequently for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, which is a sin: and it belongs to the New Law, as leaving an Unbeliever under the condemnation of the Old Law both for that sin of unbelief, and also for all other sins, from the guilt of which he cannot be freed, because he doth not perform the Condition, which the New Law to that end doth require of him. And (as I have before noted) the Condemnation of an Unbeliever is now increased, as his Sin is, by neglecting Salvation offered upon condition of believing.</p>

But why may it not be said, That as the Precept, which is also the Condition, ceaseth not, though none be able to obey it: so the Promise doth remain, though none can enjoy the benefit of it? It may seem unreasonable, that the Threatning should still be in force, and the Promise be quite taken away.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61305:373"/> perfectly made manifest as it shall be. The freedom from condemnation <hi>per sententiam Judicis,</hi> of which you speak, doth not add to the freedom it self, but only to the manifestation of it. The Sentence is indeed past alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. though it be not so solemnly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as it shall be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that is freed from all Condemnation, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from all Accusation, so as that no Accusation can be prejudicial to him; though he may be accused, yet it matters not, seeing he cannot be condemned. Else the Apostle had triumphed before the Victory, saying, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth?</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apostle doth not only say, <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. but also, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?</hi> v. 33. <hi>viz.</hi> when they are in Christ, and so justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Which in effect is as much, as if it were said, There shall be no condemnation to such. But you grant, That other Texts speak as much, and that such neither now are, nor ever shall be under condemnation. Yet you say, That they would be to morrow condemned, if no more were done than is done. You mean (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) if they did not renew the Act of Faith: but (I say, and you grant it) they who are once justified, though they sin daily, yea, and may lie long in sin, as <hi>David</hi> did, yet they shall renew the Act of Faith, and have the joy of God's Salvation restored unto them, as he prayed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 12. Neither is there any intercisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Justification, though there may be a privation of the joy and comfort of it.</p>
                  <p>To your Objections, I answer, <hi>Ad</hi> 1. He that is once justified, can contract no guilt so as to fall from his Justification. Besides, when I spake of Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect, I only mean, That a Justified Person is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, not in part only, but fully, <hi>i. e.</hi> from all sins which at present he is guilty of: not but that his Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath need to be renewed in respect of new sins; and so his Justification may be said to increase <hi>extensivè,</hi> as extending to more and more sins, as they are increased more and more. But that in this respect we shall be more fully justified at the last Judgment than we are now, is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61305:373"/> but by accident, and not from the Nature or Essence of Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 2. Justification <hi>per Sententiam Judicis, &amp; Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam magis publicam,</hi> makes (as I said) but for the more full and perfect manifestation of it. <hi>In die</hi>

So if by <hi>[Marriage not solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized]</hi> you mean a Marriage not publickly celebrated, I see not but that a Marriage privately celebrated may be in it self as perfect as the other.

What you say of Mr. <hi>Lawson,</hi> as if he held, That Justification here is but a right to Justification here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I much wonder at: His Reasons I know not, but if that be his Opinion, the whole current of Scripture, and the general consent of Divines (I think) is against him. Whereas you call the solemn pronouncing of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the last day, Sentential Justification, I should rather call it, Publick Sentential Justification, or a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manifestation of the Sentence of Justification.

Neither do I think that our Divines commonly using the word <hi>[Justification]</hi> for Justification (as you say) by Sentence, do understand it of the Sentence at the last Day, but of the Sentence whereby God doth now justifie those that believe.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will say, Where is that Sentence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is in the Scripture. But (you may say) The Scripture speaks only in general. Well, but if God in the Scripture say, That <hi>all that believe are justified,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. then consequently he saith, That you and I believing, are justified. And this Sentence God by his Spirit doth bring home to Believers in particular; though it is true, they have not that clear evidence and full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as they shall have hereafter. So for Condemnation at the last day, I think it to be but a more solemn and publick pronouncing of the Sentence, together with the immediate and full execution of it. For otherwise the Sentence is past already, <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> John 3. 18. I do not deny, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative Justification at the last Judgment, is properly Justification; only I think it is the same Justification which Believers here have, though it shall then be more fully manifested than now it is. That which you speak of Justification being more full at death than before, only shews that it is more full <hi>Extensivè,</hi> as freeing from the guilt of more sins: but that is only <hi>per accidens;</hi> Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in it self considered, was as perfect before: for it freed from all sin, and from all Condemnation, and the other doth no more.</p>

                     <hi>not one real Person with Christ, then one what?]</hi> I could not tell: but the words did seem to imply, That we must either be one real Person with Christ, or else we could not any way be one with him; whereas the Scripture is clear, that Believers are one with Christ though that they are one real Person with him, is no to be admitted.

                     </gap>o answer as I did, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are <hi>one Spirit,</hi> as the Apostle expresseth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. that is, spiritually one with Christ, as being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one and the same Spirit with him. No doubt but further Queries may still be made: and who is able to clear all Difficulties that do occur in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Yet I see not why we should not content our selves with those Similitudes and Resemblances, which the Scripture doth use to illustrate this Mystery, as of the <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> Joh. 15. and of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> Ephes. 5.</p>

                  <p>I have shewed my meaning all along, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ's <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 51.</note> Satisfaction, and not Faith, is properly that by which we are justified. Whereas you say, <hi>[We are justified by Faith it self, as the Condition, and not so by Christ]</hi> I can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it only thus, That Faith is the Condition required of us, that so we may be justified by Christ. Otherwise I cannot yeeld, that the performing of the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us unto Justification, is properly that by which we are justified; but of that enough before. For the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and Act of Faith, I little doubt but that Habits and Acts are of a different nature. For Habits may be in us when we sleep, or otherwise do not act and exercise those Habits. I think also, that though acquired Habits fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Acts, yet infused Habits (such as Faith is) go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Act of Faith being the receiving of Christ, I see not how any can make the Act of Faith, but the Habit to be the Instrument of receiving Christ. And if any of our Divines say, That it is not the Habit of Faith, but the Act that doth justifie; I think they mean, that Faith doth justifie as acting, <hi>i. e.</hi> receiving Christ. So that they do not deny the Habit of Faith to justifie, yea, they make it the instrumental cause of Justification; only they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61305:375"/> make the Act of Faith requisite unto Justification. The Similitude betwixt the Hand and Faith is to the purpose, though they differ as you say. No Similitude is to be set on the Rack: if it seem to illustrate that for which it is used, it is sufficient. But except you speak of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural perfection of the Soul, I see not how Faith is the perfection of it. For the Soul hath its natural perfection without Faith, or any other Habit. Whereas you labour much to prove, that the Habit of Faith is not properly an Instrument, I think you trouble your self to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, though (I know) you have some end in it. But what if it be not an Instrument properly, if yet it may not unfitly be so termed? And for any thing I see, it may, even as generally Divines do so term it.</p>

                  <p>I will add to these one more, <hi>viz. J. Goodwin,</hi> who <note place="margin">Of Justif. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 90.</note> though in divers things he be cross and contrary to our Divines, yet in this, at least in words, he doth comply with them, professing to hold, That <hi>Faith doth justifie instrumentally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the propriety of Words must always be strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, we shall scarce know how to speak: It is well if we can find words, whereby to express our selves so as that others may understand (if they please) what we mean. All that our Divines mean, when they speak of Faith justifying Instrumentally, or as an Instrument, I suppose, is this, and so much also they usually express, That Faith doth not justifie absolutely, or in respect of it self, but Relatively in respect of its Object, Christ and his Righteousness laid hold on and received by Faith. Neither should you (me-thinks) strive about the word <hi>[Receiving]</hi> how it should be the Act of Faith. It suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, That the Scripture makes Believing in Christ, and Receiving of Christ, one and the same, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. That which you say of our most famous Writers ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily laying the main stress of the Reformed Cause and Doctrine on a plain Error, did deserve to have been either further manifested, or quite concealed; to me it seems very injurious both to our most famous Writers, and also to the Reformed Cause and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>My meaning is, That Faith justifieth, as it apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> and receiveth Christ, whom the Gospel doth give for Righteousness to such as receive him, <hi>i. e.</hi> believe in him.

                  <p>You mistake my Argument, and do not mind the Text which I alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all that believe are justified,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore not only all that believe in Christ are justified, but it is by him that they are justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Obedience, as it is expressed <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. So that Christ's Obedience is that which is properly imputed for Righteousness, though it be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted only to those that believe; Faith to apprehend it, is required of us, that it may be imputed to us; and in that respect Faith is said to be imputed for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Note seems to shew thus much, That some may make Faith an Instrument of Justification, and yet deny that we are properly justified by it as by an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61305:379"/> Though if this be granted, I see not what you gain by it. For (as I said in the <hi>Animadversion)</hi> they that make Faith an Instrument of Justification, when they deny that we are properly justified by Faith; they mean, That Faith is not the <note n="*" place="margin">

That this is the meaning of our Divines, appears by that which I have before alledged.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore who those be, of whom you speak, I do not know: However, I do not see that your Objections are of force. For Faith is not wholly excluded as to the Text, though it be so interpreted, as that by [Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pured] is meant Christ and his Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> before cited.</note> as apprehended by Faith; and I presume that they whom you tax, did so understand it. And this doth not exclude Faith, but include it. Your Question therefore seems captious, <hi>[If by Faith be meant Christ's Righteousness, then what word doth signifie Faith?]</hi> For by Faith is not simply meant Christ's Righteousness, but as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, which I cited, are clearly to the purpose to which I cited them; neither do I see any thing in them, which argue him to have been of another mind than I am of. Whereas you add, <hi>[It seems he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the mistake of them, that affirm Christ's Active Righteousness as such to be our Righteousness].</hi> I think your Scribe did mistake, and it should be, [he discerned not]. For therein indeed, in that Chapter, but not in the words which I cited, he differs both from you and me: But I was willing to let that pass, both because it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our present purpose; and also I like not to shew my dissent from any eminent Writer, except I be forced to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What you say you will alledge out of <hi>Davenant</hi> against me, is to be considered when it is alledged.

                     <hi>cause of Justification, is as if one should ask what is the Latin for</hi> Manus: <hi>and that it is the folly or knavery of our Adversaries to demand a formal Cause of their Justification, who deny themselves to be formally just in the sight of God.

                  <p>Thus there is difference among our Divines about the term, but they agree in the thing.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61305:381"/> a want of the Condition required in the Gospel, so (as I have said before) it is no new accusation, but only a re-inforcing of a former accusation; and so the refelling of this Accusation, by shewing the fruits of Faith and Repentance, is not properly a justifying of our selves by any thing in our selves, but only a proving and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting that we are indeed justified by the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. What others, of whom you speak do, I know not; <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> they may answer for themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I take affiance (which is a Believing in, or Relying on) to be an Act of Faith it self, the Act of Faith being as well <hi>Credere in,</hi> as <hi>simpliciter Credere.</hi> But internal Obedience or Love, (for these you make both one, though indeed Believing it self is inward Obedience as well as Love, the one being commanded as well as the other) is not the Act of Faith, though caused by Faith; not <hi>actus dicitus,</hi> though <hi>actus imperatus:</hi> therefore this is not so immediate a product of Faith as the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I conceive Affiance to be a part of Justifying-Faith, and not only a Fruit of it. <hi>To believe in Christ,</hi> which is as much as to rely on him, and to have affiance in him, is requisite unto Justification. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned,</hi> John 3. 18.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As Justification is begun upon sole Believing, so is <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it also continued and consummated. The Scripture (so far as I see) makes Justification simply and absolutely to depend on Faith, and not only in respect of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it: yet (it is true) Justification is neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, nor continued, nor consummated upon such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as is not attended with other Duties.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61305:382"/> apply it. And therefore we often find in Scripture, That the Axiome or Proposition concerning Christ, is made the Object of Justifying and Saving Faith, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 69.

                  </p>
                  <p>But I willingly grant, That the Axiome, Proposition or Promise doth but serve to convey Christ unto us, and the apprehending and receiving of him, is the Faith by which we are justified. Only I say, it is Christ in the Promise, or Christ promised, who must be apprehended and received unto Justification.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Where do I say, That the receiving of Christ as King doth justifie, that you ask me in what sense it doth so? I say, Justifying Faith doth receive Christ as King, but not as justifying; or that Faith in that respect doth not justifie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith as the Condition of Justification is the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ as satisfying for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Christ's Satisfaction only be our Righteousness, by which we are justified; and Christ as Priest only made Satisfaction for us, then by receiving Christ as Priest only we are justified. This you might perceive was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Argument, though I left out the word [only].</p>
                  <p>And here also I have Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> agreeing with me, as (I think) in every point, wherein we differ, if he have occasion to treat of it. <q rend="margQuotes">[It is true <hi>(saith he)</hi> that <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> Faith accepts Christ as Lord as well as Saviour: but it is the acceptation of him as Saviour, not as Lord, that justifies. Christ rules his People as a King, teacheth them as a Prophet, but makes atonement for them as a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61305:383"/> Priest, by giving himself in Sacrifice, his Blood for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins. These must be distinguished, but not divided: Faith hath an eye at all, the Blood of Christ, the Command of Christ, the Doctrine of Christ: but as it ties and fasteus on his Blood, so it justifies. <hi>He is set out a propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. not through Faith in his Command. It is the Blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin, and not the Sovereignty of Christ. These confusions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct parts of Christ's Mediatorship, and the several offices of Faith may not be suffered. Scripture assigns each its particular Place and Work. Sovereignty doth not cleanse, nor Blood command us: Faith in his Blood, not Faith yeelding to his Sovereignty, doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us. There are several acts of Justifying-Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. but those are not acts of Justification. It is not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience, <hi>Moses</hi> Self-denyal, <hi>Gideon</hi> or <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Valour, that was their Justification, but his Blood, who did enable them in these things by his Spirit].</q>

                  <p>Your Similitude is not suitable; for a Woman recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Man for her Husband, may be enriched or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him, though she never look at him as rich or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, but only as her Husband. But we must look at Christ as a Priest, and as making Satisfaction for us, that so we may be justified by him. For the Scripture doth set forth Christ unto us in that respect for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; see <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Rom.</hi> 8. 34. where those words <hi>[It is Christ that died]</hi> shew how Christ doth justifie us, and free us from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> by dying, and so satisfying for our sins. That which follows of Christ's Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> seems (as to our Justification) but for our more full assurance of the benefit of Christ's Death, and for the effectual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Satisfaction, which he made for us by his Death, that so we may be justified by him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You grant, that Christ, not as King, but as Priest, doth justifie us meritoriously and satisfactorily; and that is it which I urge, That Christ's Satisfaction, which as Priest he made for us, is that whereby, or for which we are justified. Now we speak of receiving Christ unto Justification, therefore we must consider him as satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, and so receive him as to that purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61305:384"/> our Justification; though (I grant) whole Christ, or Christ in respect of all his Offices must be received; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we think to have him as a Priest to satisfie for us, except we also have him as a Prophet to instruct us, and as a King to govern us.

                  <p n="1">1. When you say, That I leave the Errour in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> but not in his Sense, your words are ambiguous. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>(p.</hi> 69.)</note> For they may import, That I leave, <hi>i. e.</hi> relinquish and desert the Error the one way, but not the other. Or that I leave, <hi>i. e.</hi> let the Error abide and remain in his Language, but not in his Sense. This I take to be your meaning, for else you could not say (except ironically, which I do not suspect) that it is a fair Exposition, and that you like it. I have no reason to strive about another's words, especially not knowing how they are brought in: but I think meet to interpret words in the best sense that they will bear: neither do I yet see but those words which you tax as foully erroneous, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that fair interpretation which I made of them.</p>

Neither again doth he speak of Christ in all respects, but as Christ is the Propitiation for our sins, as is clear by that very place which you now take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to consideration.</p>
                  <p>Besides, I find <hi>Amesius</hi> to have such words as you mention, but withall to add such, as plainly to express what I say. <hi>Christus (inquit) est adaequatum objectum</hi>

For <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. the Apostle speaketh of God's great love manifested unto us, in giving his Son for us.

                  <p n="2">2. There is more than a bare assenting Act of Faith going before the Love, of which I speak.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Embracing, which from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.

All that you add, holds only in respect of the former kind, not in respect of the latter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are divers kinds of Love, but I speak of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/> Love which differs from Desire; and so did you seem to understand it, as I noted from your words, <hi>Aphorism,</hi> p. 267.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas you say, <hi>[There is no need of Faith to make it present, before it can be accepted and loved];</hi> you cannot by Faith mean Assent, for that, you grant, doth go before Love and Acceptance. And if by Faith you mean Acceptance, surely there must be Acceptance, before a thing can be accepted, though in time these go together. But perhaps you only mean, That though Faith as an Assent, must go before in time, and as an Acceptance must go before in Nature, yet not so as to make a thing present. For you add, That God's Offer doth make it present. But though the Offer be present, yet the thing offered is not present, so as the Object of the Love of Complacency must be: for it must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by way of Enjoyment, but the offer of a thing can only make it to be hoped for; so that the thing, though it be offered, yet until it be accepted, it is absent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not enjoyed. The thing offered must be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and in that respect lovingly accepted; but it must first be accepted, and then loved, so as to joy and delight in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We look at Christ as enjoyed, when we love him with the Love of Complacency and Delight, of which Love I speak.</p>

Therefore I said, [Love as you take it, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth its Object as present and enjoyed] <hi>viz.</hi> Love as distinguished from Desire.

The places, which you alledg <hi>(John</hi> 16. 27. and <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 14. 21.) do not prove, that Love, <hi>viz.</hi> our Love is an antecedent Condition of God's Love, and Christ's Love to us, so that we must first love God and Christ, before we can be reconciled unto God in Christ. For because we are reconciled unto God in Christ, therefore we love God and Christ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19▪ The meaning of those other places (as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes) is this, That they that love God, <hi>insculptum habent in cordibus Paterni ejus amoris testimonium:</hi> To which may be added, That God will still manifest his Love to them more and more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only Love, but Obedience also must go before Glorification; but it doth not therefore follow, That they must go before Justification, as your self hold that Obedience doth not as we are at first justified.

Perhaps you speak of it only in respect of its Generical Nature, abstracting from the consideration of either Desire or Complacency, which are the Species of it: but surely these two taking up the whole nature of Love, that Love which is not the one of these, must needs be the other. We accept or chuse a thing, because we first Love, <hi>i. e.</hi> desire it, or (as we use to say) have a mind to it: and having accepted and chosen it, we further love it, so as to delight in it, except our Love turn into Hatred, as <hi>Ammon</hi>'s unchast Love did: but the very Accepting of Chusing of a thing is not (that I see) properly a Loving of it.</p>

The Grant of a thing being Condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I grant that the receiving of Christ in respect of any one Office doth vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually include the receiving of him in respect of all his Offices: and he that doth not so receive Christ in respect of his Priestly Office, as to be ready to receive him also in respect of his Kingly Office, when Christ shall so be set forth unto him, doth not at all receive him: such a Faith is a false Faith, and cannot justifie. Yet may there be a receiving of Christ as Priest without an express and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect receiving of him as King, though implicitly and by consequence he be received as such. Neither is it a false Knowledg, though it be an imperfect Knowledg to know Christ as a Priest, and not to know him as a King.

And though he be (as sometimes he is) expresly set forth at once both as Priest and King, and so must expresly be received at once in both respects; yet it hinders not, but that the receiving of Christ as Priest, and not the receiving of him as King, is that which justifieth.

                  <p>So far as I can judg, your success is not answerable to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> your desire. But if you did not intend to infer such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from your earnest seeking the Lord's Direction on <note place="margin">(74.)</note> your Knees, I know not to what purpose you did speak
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61305:388"/> of it. For if it were only to shew the sincerity of your desire, What is your Cause advantaged, though that be granted, as I know not why any should question it?</p>
                  <p>What is that which you say is yeelded? That Faith <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> doth not justifie, as it is the fulfilling of the Condition of the whole Covenant? Yet you make Justifying-Faith, as such, to be the Condition of the whole Covenant. For you make it to include Obedience: and what doth the Covenant require more than Faith and Obedience?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Justification begun, and Justification continued and consummated by sentence at Judgment, I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, nor is there need here to say any more of it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Though our Divines in expounding the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> express themselves diversly, yet they agree in the Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That Works do not concur with Faith unto Justification.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> speaking of those words, [Faith is imputed <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> unto Righteousness] saith, <hi>[This Passage is diversly interpreted by Orthodox Divines, all aiming at the same Truth, and meeting in the Main, being rather several Expressions of the same Truth, than different Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he shews three several ways whereby those words are interpreted, which differ as much as these Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which you mention. They that say, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh of Justification <hi>coram Deo,</hi> by Works, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a Working-Faith: They that expound it of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification <hi>coram Hominibus,</hi> take the meaning to be, That by Works a Man doth appear to be justified. They that understand it of the Justification of the Person, make the sense the same with those first mentioned: and they that say it is meant of the Justification of a Man's Faith, agree with those in the second place, making Works to prove the sincerity of Faith, and so to manifest a Man's Justification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Are not those words <hi>[Hoc est Corpus meum]</hi> as express words of Scripture, as those which you alledg? Though words be never so express, yet not only <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>James</hi> might well and solidly prove by Works done
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61305:388"/> many years after, that the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereby he was justified, was a Working-Faith, of a Working Nature, a Faith fruitful in good Works, his Faith bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth such fruit in due season, and so shewing it self by Works when occasion did require. <hi>Abraham</hi> (no doubt) had many other Works, whereby his Faith did appear, yet the Apostle thought meet to instance in that Work, which was most remarkable; and by which his Faith did manifest it self in a more especial manner.</p>

                  <p>What your Parenthesis doth mean <hi>(Legal Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I mean)</hi> I do not well understand. But how doth <hi>James</hi> speak of Justification as Continued, and not as Begun? Is his meaning this, That a Man is indeed at first justified by Faith only, but both Faith and Works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do continue his Justification? So you understand it: but surely <hi>James</hi> doth neither speak, nor mean so. For by Faith alone without Works, in his sense, a Man never was, never can be justified. This is clear by his whole Discourse, for he calls him a vain Man that relies on such a Faith, and calls it a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> &amp;c. So that when a Man is first justified, it is by a Working Faith: not that Faith must necessarily produce Works at the first, but it is (as I said) of a Working Nature, of such a Nature as to produce Works when they are required; which is the same with what you say out of <hi>Grotius:</hi> and this doth answer all that you object against the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I stand for. Who can doubt but <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified long before he offered up <hi>Isaac,</hi> the Scripture being express for it? But how then? Therefore this Work could be no Condition of that Justification which was past.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> No indeed, that Work was not, nor could be; but Faith apt to shew it self by that Work, or any other, when required, and consequently a Working Faith might be, and was the Condition of that Justification. <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whom you cite, giving you such a hint of it, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that you could not observe this. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> may well enough be reconciled, though both of them speak of Justification as Begun. For <hi>James</hi> doth not require Works otherwise than as Fruits of Faith, to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61305:389"/> brought forth in time convenient: and <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Works in that sense.</p>

The other, What Faith justifies, whether a Working-Faith only, and not a Faith that is dead &amp; idle? Or else I know not how to make sense of the Apostle, who straight infers from</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by the offer of his Son; And the Scripture was fulfilled, that saith,</hi> Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness. <hi>How otherwise do these accord? He was justified by Works, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was fulfilled, that saith, He was justified by Faith? Neither can I reconcile what he saith, if this be denied, with the whole current of the Gospel].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he adds a little after, <hi>[All Works before or after Conversion, are inherent in us, or wrought by us, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Justification].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Interpretations, <hi>viz.

Will you say with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the first Justification, doth fetch a proof from the second?

                  <p>Thus also Mr. <hi>Ball, [Faith is perfected by Works, not that the Nature of Faith receiveth complement or perfection from Works, but because it doth declare and manifest it self by Love and good Works, and is esteemed so much the more perfect, as the Works produced are the more excellent].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To illustrate this, I used also the Similitude of a Tree, <note place="margin">Animad. pag. 54. <hi>Where I also cited Dr</hi> Preston <hi>thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this similitude to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it.</hi>
                     </note> the goodness of whose Fruit doth but manifest the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it; and so the power of Faith doth but appear by its fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> Works. You say that Faith is really perfected by Works, as a Tree is by bearing fruit. But (as our Saviour saith) <hi>a Tree is known by his Fruit.</hi> The Fruit doth not make the Tree good, but only shew it to be so. And this very Similitude have Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines used to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beza</hi> immediately after the words before cited adds, <hi>Ʋt si dicatur alicujus arboris bonitas tum fuisse perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, quum optimum aliquem frructum edidit.

                     <hi>Form is not perfect, when it is considered as the first Act, but when it is taken as the second Act; for by working it putteth forth its force, and declareth it self. And so Faith is perfected by Works,</hi> &amp;c.] as before cited.</p>
                  <p>You say also, That Faith is really perfected by Works, as a Covenant or Promise is by Performance. But the Performance doth only manifest the perfection of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Promise. It is a perfect Covenant or Promise, as soon as it is made, if it be made sincerely and without guile, though it appears more fully to be so when it is performed. Again you say, That Faith is really perfected by Works, as it hath <hi>naturam medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>St. <hi>James</hi> doth not speak of Works perfecting Faith more to the continuing and consummating of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to the beginning of it. For (which must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be remembred) he speaks of Faith as <hi>apta nata ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari:</hi> and such a Faith is requisite, that we may be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as well at first as afterward. Otherwise Works nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at first nor afterward do concur with Faith to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>

                     <hi>[A preparation or promptitude of Heart</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Of Faith, Part 1. c. 4. p. 57. <hi>Ib.</hi> Part 2. c. 4. p. 253.</note> Mr. <hi>Ball) to good Works, is an effect of Faith as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate as Justification].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, <hi>[Faith doth not begin to apprehend Life, and leave the accomplishment to Works, but doth rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Promise of Life until we come to enjoy it].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet again you say, That Faith is really perfected by Works, as Works are a part of that necessary Matter (not necessary at the first moment of Believing, but necessary afterward, when we are called to it) whereby we are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61305:392"/> justified against the Charge of non-performance of the New-Covenants Condition, even against the Charge of being an Unbeliever or an Hypocrite. But all this proves not that Works give any perfection to Faith, but only that they shew the perfection, <hi>i. e.</hi> the sincerity, force, and efficacy of it. Works may manifest a Man to be no Unbeliever or Hypocrite: but it is his Faith, which being unfained, doth indeed make him to be no Unbeliever or Hypocrite.

What Work can be named, that is enjoyned us in the New Testament, which is not commanded us in that summary Precept of the Moral Law,</hi> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy

But this is far, and very far too from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Works to have a co-interest with Faith in the effect of justifying. For your Reasons why the Apostle doth not exclude all Works absolutely from Justification, I see no strength in them: and therefore I answer;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 1. That which you call Justification against the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of final Unbelief, is indeed <hi>Justification</hi> against the Accusation of Transgressing the whole Law. For that Accusation being only made void by Faith, where there is final Unbelief, there that Accusation hath its full force. Besides, though the Accusation of final Unbelief may be proved to be false by Works, yet Works upon this account do no otherwise justifie, than by manifesting a Man's Faith, by which Faith indeed, and not by Works he is justified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 2. So also that Justification which <hi>James</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, is against a true Charge, and the same with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of sins, as well as that which <hi>Paul</hi> doth speak of. For can they that have but a dead <hi>Faith,</hi> be justified against a true Charge and have their sins remitted? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it must be a Living and a Working <hi>Faith,</hi> such as <hi>James</hi> doth require, can work that Effect. Justification against a false Accusation, is but such a Justification as the worst of Men and the Devils themselves are capable of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nemo enim iniquus adeò,</hi> (as <hi>Bradshaw</hi> speaketh) <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Justification against the Accusation of final Unbelief, is by consequence a Justification against all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61305:393"/> Accusations, because <hi>Faith</hi> is the Condition and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Universal Justification. But hence it follows that we are justified universally by <hi>Faith,</hi> and not by <hi>Works,</hi> which are only an Argument <hi>à posteriori</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so of Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 3. All Works that have a co-interest with <hi>Faith</hi> in Justification, are Competitors with Christ, or Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with him; so that Justification must be partly by the Righteousness of Christ through <hi>Faith,</hi> and partly by <hi>Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad</hi> 4. As the Righteousness of Christ is freely given or imputed at first upon condition of <hi>Faith,</hi> so is the free gift and imputation of it still continued upon the same condition of <hi>Faith;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> both when Justification is first begun, and when it is continued, must be a <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Faith, i. e.</hi> ready to work as occasion doth require. If our Divines affirm, That the Apostle speaking against Justification by Works, means in point of merit, (as you say you could bring multitudes of them to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) surely it is, because they know no other Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Works, but that which doth presuppose Works to be meritorious.</p>
                  <p>Hear one whom I (and so I presume you also) take for a good Divine, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake, [This Justification</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 80.</note> (saith he) <hi>wrought freely by Grace through Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>is no way consistent with Justification by Works. And what the Apostle speaks of Election, we may well apply to Justification: the same medium equally proves the truth of both; If by Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwise Grace were no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace, otherwise Works were no more Works,</hi> Rom. 11. 6.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> also useth this Argument to confute those who would have Works to concur with <hi>Faith</hi> unto Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that then we should have somewhat to boast of, which is not to be admitted. <hi>Sed quoniam (inquit) bona</hi>

All good Works (as I have shewed before) and consequently those whereby we perform obedience to the Redeemer, are works of the Law, it being the Rule to which they must be conformed.

Now to your Answers to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>oppositum</hi> I reply; And for the firs;t thus; If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Gospel-Works did justifie him otherwise than by evidencing his Faith, whereby he was justified, if they be made to have a co-interest with Faith in his Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then they are set in Competition or Copartnership with Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>That no Work of the Gospel doth justifie; Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Justif. §. 2. ch. 2. §. 2. See <hi>Rivet</hi> as cited pag. 145.</note> proveth by this, That every Work of the Gospel, is a Work of the Law also; and therefore the Apostle deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Man is justified by the Works of the Law, doth consequently deny that he is justified by the Works of the Gospel. That Works do justifie as Conditions under Christ, is repugnant to what your self hold in respect of Justification as begun: and I see not, that the Scripture shews us any other Condition of Justification afterward than at first.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My Conclusion; That <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by Works, but by Faith, is not against <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 21. no more than <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. is.

                     <hi>Ad</hi> 2. It is granted, That <hi>Faith</hi> which is no more than a bare Assent, is neither Justifying nor Saving: But what of this? Is there no other <hi>Faith</hi> than Assent? Do not you your self make Acceptance, which is more than Assent, the compleating Act of Justifying <hi>Faith?</hi> And how can you say, That there is the same force ascribed to VVorks as to <hi>Faith,</hi> when you make Justification at first to be by <hi>Faith</hi> without VVorks? Indeed VVorks are requisite in their place, but not as having the like force with <hi>Faith</hi> unto Justification, (shew any Orthodox VVriter that doth hold so) though as necessary Fruits of that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are justified. Say not that you speak of Justification as continued, for VVorks, as St. <hi>James</hi> doth speak of them, are as necessary unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification at first as afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> a promptitude and readiness to do good VVorks: if this be wanting, it is no Justifying <hi>Faith,</hi> but (as St. <hi>James</hi> calls it) <hi>a dead Faith,</hi> altogether vain and unprofitable.</p>

For surely Justification cannot be at first by a dead and unprofitable Faith, as he affirms that to be, which is without VVorks. That in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 22. cannot be meant that Faith by VVorks is made perfect, as accomplishing its ends, but only as thereby declared and manifested to be perfect. The end of Faith is to justifie; and your self say, That Faith at first doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie without Works: so that in your Opinion Faith without VVorks is perfect, accomplishing its end in justifying at first. But in St. <hi>James</hi> his sense Faith doth not, cannot
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61305:397"/> at all justifie without VVorks, <hi>i. e.</hi> if it be not ready to work: and in that respect VVorks do perfect Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> they make the perfection of Faith to appear: but of that enough before.</p>

                  <p>I think that although Justifying-Faith doth receive Christ intirely, yet as Justifying it receiveth him only in respect of his Satisfaction, which is the Righteousness by which we are justified. There is no danger in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, so long as People are taught withal, that they must not look to have Christ as a Priest satisfying for them, except they also have him as a King reigning over them. Neither doth it seem to me any gross conceit, That apprehending or applying of Christ's Satisfaction, or of Christ as satisfying for us, is that act of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are justified. Your Similitude doth not suit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Husband cannot be offered to a VVoman in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral respects, as Christ may be unto a Sinner. I do not conceive Faith to justifie <hi>modo physico,</hi> or merely because it is of that nature to apprehend Christ and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: If it were not for the Promise of the Gospel, this Act of Faith would not avail. As suppose the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils should apprehend the Righteousness of Christ, yet should they not be justified, because the Promise of the Gospel doth not belong unto them. Yet this apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ and his Righteousness being the Physical
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61305:399"/> Act of Faith, and withal made the Condition of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in that the Gospel doth promise Justification unto those that apprehend Christ and his Righteousness; I see not but I may well say, That Faith doth justifie us, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Christ and his Righteousness, this being it which the Gospel doth require unto Justification. Faith as apprehending Christ being the Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is all one to say, Faith do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h justifie as apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christ, and Faith doth justifie as the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto Justification. Whereas therefore you prove, That Faith or Acceptance of Christ simply considered in it self doth not justifie; it is nothing to me, who do not ascribe any thing to Faith in order to Justification as it is considered simply in it self, but as it being of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in that respect required of us, to that end that we may be justified. And thus (I think) do others mean, when they say, That Faith doth justifie as apprehending Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61305:400"/> acknowledgment of, and sorrow for sin, is requisite unto Justification at first. For how should we ever look unto Christ as suffering for our sins, except we be sensible of them, and humbled for them. Yet it is Faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christ, which in the Covenant is made the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Justification, as that whereby we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Christ's Righteousness, by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It is neither Repentance, nor Obedience, though Repentance (in the sence before-mentioned) must go before this Justifying-Faith, and so before Justification; and obedience must follow after.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. You need not trouble your self to prove, That by <note place="margin">69, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> VVorks are meant VVorks. For surely a working Faith, or a Faith bringing forth the Fruit of VVorks, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply VVorks. But the Question is, VVhether VVorks concur with Faith in justifying, or only are inseparable Attendants, and necessary Fruits of that Faith which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth. You hold the former, yet only in respect of continued and consummate Justification: I hold the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in respect of Justification begun, continued, and consummate. VVhether of us hath more ground from Scripture, let it be judged by what hath been said about it.</p>
                  <p>But 1. whereas you say, That VVorks are still oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Faith without VVorks, or Faith alone, and not to this or that sort of Faith: I have shewed before from <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius</hi> (not to speak of our late VVriters) that there is one sort of Faith that is with VVorks, or of a working Disposition, and such is Faith truly apprehending Christ:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61305:400"/> and another sort of Faith, that is without VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi> a bare Assent: and that St. <hi>James</hi> doth oppose these two sorts of Faith one to the other, teaching that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the former, not by the latter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You say, <hi>[It is not only Faith alone without a working disposition, but Faith alone without Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when there is opportunity];</hi> yet your self deny not only the efficacy, but even the presence of VVorks to be requisite, when we are at first justified: and St. <hi>James</hi> denies Faith alone (so as he doth speak of it) to have any force at all to justifie, as being dead and unprofitable. Therefore you must needs grant, That it is Faith alone, without a working Disposition of which St. <hi>James</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Besides, if there be a working Disposition, there will be VVorks themselves when there is opportunity. But all this doth only prove, That Justifying Faith is of a working Disposition, and produceth VVorks themselves when opportunity is offered: That VVorks do at any time concur with Faith unto Justification, it no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Surely a disposition to feed the hungry, is accepted of God, when there is no opportunity to do the thing it self. And so a Disposition to work may be enough to prove Faith to be of a right stamp, though VVorks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be requisite when there is opportunity: and still I must put you in mind, that your self requires no more than a disposition to work, when we are first justified.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What you can infer from <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. I do not see. He that expects mercy from God, must shew mercy to his Neighbour. Doth it therefore follow, that VVorks of Mercy justifie as well as Faith? No, but that Justifying Faith must and will shew it self by VVorks of Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A real Faith being but a bare Assent, as in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, cannot justifie or save. Who opposeth this? Or whom doth it oppose? So, that the same Faith is justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and saving, I think all will yeeld: yet is there more required unto Salvation, as taken for the accomplishment of it, than unto Justification.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. VVho makes <hi>James</hi> v. 18. to speak such non-sence as you tell of? Do they, who say his meaning is, That Faith is pretended in vain, if it do not shew it self by VVorks, as occasion doth require? And what more can any gather from <hi>v.</hi> 20, 22, 24, 26? You might save your
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61305:401"/> labour of proving, That by VVorks are meant VVorks you should prove that Works are spoken of as concurring with Faith, and as having a co-interest with it in the effect of justifying, and not only as Fruits of that Faith by which we are justified. This is that which they mean, who say that <hi>James</hi> doth speak of a working Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Faith ready to work, and so actually working, when God doth require it, not as if instead of [Works] it were good sense always to put [a working Faith]. Such sophistry doth not become us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That <hi>James</hi> doth assert the necessity of Works, as fruits of Justifying Faith, is ever granted: that he doth assert the necessity of them as concurrent with Faith unto Justification, is never proved. Works are therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prove Faith to be such as God requires unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
                  <p>Against this first you say, <hi>James</hi> doth make VVorks or Working necessary to justifie; I say, he doth not, but only drives at this, That none must think to be justified by Faith, except it be a working Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>Rahab</hi>'s was.

                  <p n="3">3. Faith may be real, and yet not justifying. A real Assent, yea and Consent, if limited, so as to exclude Christ's dominion over us, is not that Faith which your Opposers plead for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The New Testament doth make a working Faith, yet not Faith as working the Condition of Justification. I wonder how you can stumble at this, when as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly hold, That we are justified at first by Faith without Works: yet surely that Faith whereby we are justified at first, is a working Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a working Nature, and will, when there is opportunity, shew it self by Works. That working therefore is together with Faith the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justification, is more than your own Principles will admit, without that distinction of Justification In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choated, and Justification Continued, of which though you make much use, yet I see little ground for it. Now for Dr. <hi>Preston</hi>'s words, which I cited, I think they are clear enough against you.</p>
                  <p>For first he saith, That Faith alone justifieth and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Works only Concomitants or Fruits of that Faith by which we are justified. You limit it to Justification as begun, but he speaks of Justification simply considered, and not as begun only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He speaks indeed of a double Justification, but not as you do, not to that intent to bring in a double Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness as requisite unto Justification. All that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends is this, That we are justified only by Faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine; yet (as <hi>James</hi> teacheth) our Faith must appeat to be a true Justifying Faith by VVorks, otherwise it is but a false and feigned Faith, as it preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be Justifying, and he that pretendeth it, is a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. His words without doing violence unto them, can have no other sense put upon them. VVhen any one is accused of being but a seeming Believer, or a mere Believer without Obedience, take Believing merely as it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61305:402"/> is the Condition of Justification by the Covenant, it is but (as I have often said) the making good this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, That he is a Transgressor of the Law, and to be condemned by the Law for the transgression of it, and so much the more in that he neglected the benefit offered in the New Covenant. So that in this case to justifie a Man by his Faith and VVorks, is but indeed to plead that he is justified by the Righteousness of Christ imputed unto him through Faith, which Faith is proved to be sound and good by his VVorks.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I see you are very tenacious of your Opinion: but if you will not forsake your Opinion till you see better Arguments to draw you from it, marvel not if others will not embrace your Opinion till they see better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw them to it. But to the Matter; Me-thinks you might easily see the meaning of this, that <hi>Abraham's</hi> first Justification could not be by Faith, which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out VVorks, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Faith, which was not of a working Nature.</p>
                  <p>Thus in that very page (52.) I explained my self, saying, [Faith if it be alone without VVorks, <hi>i. e. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuens operari, &amp;c.</hi> cannot justifie].</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not you see that your Answer is to no purpose in limiting the words of the Apostle to Continued and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate Justification, whereas he doth utterly exclude Faith, which is without VVorks, or which is not of a working Disposition, from being able to justifie, as being a Faith that is dead and unprofitable?</p>
                  <p>That which you so slight, as if it were <hi>indignus vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice nodus,</hi> Calvin (a Man as likely to see into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> Jac. 2. 23.</note> meaning as another) calls <hi>nodum insolubilem,</hi> as I have before noted. That more Conditions are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto Justification afterward than at first, is more than I can find, and more (I am perswaded) than will ever be proved. Did <hi>Paul</hi> when he speaketh so much of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith without VVorks, <hi>viz.</hi> as concurring with Faith unto Justification, mean that we are so justified indeed to day, but not so to morrow, or some time after? All his Arguments shew the contrary. Yea, doth he not prove from <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified only by Believing, when as yet that was not the beginning of his Justification? So when <hi>James</hi> saith, That we are not justified by Faith, which is without VVorks, such a Faith
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61305:402"/> being dead, and no better than the Faith of Devils; was his meaning this, That hereafter indeed we cannot be so justified, but yet at present we may? If you be of this mind, <hi>Non equidem invideo, miror magis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the sense of <hi>James</hi> his Discourse enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And for <hi>v.</hi> 17. I think it might easily let you see that he speaketh not (as you suppose) only of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and Consummate Justification, but of Inchoated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and consequently that he cannot be interpreted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than thus, That Faith which doth not shew it self by VVorks, is dead, ineffectual, and of no force to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, either at first or afterward, as not being that Faith which is required unto Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> a working Faith, or Faith which is of a working Nature. I have noted before what <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (one that was long before either <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Luther)</hi> saith upon that very Verse, as also how in the judgment of the Syriack Interpreter, and other Learned Men <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> there is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though Faith may be true and real without Works, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet a living Faith it is not; for a living Faith is operative, so that, a working Faith, and a non-working Faith are of different Natures, this being but a bare and naked Assent, but the other an apprehending of Christ, and a receiving of him. I little doubt but the Faith of Devils, and the Faith of Men who are justified (even at first, when you say VVorks are not requisite in respect of their presence with Faith, though that Faith (say I) is of a working Disposition), differ much in their very Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you will be true to your own Principles, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, That VVorks make Faith alive, or that Faith is not alive without VVorks as actually present, though you consider Faith meerly as a Condition of Justification, seeing you hold Faith to be alive in that respect, when we are first justified, though there be no VVorks present with it. And though, as there must be a promptitude to VVorks at first, so there must be VVorks themselves in due season; yet that VVorks do afterward concur with Faith unto Justification, is more than yet I see, or (I presume) ever shall see proved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore my Argument stands good against you, until you can make it appear, That Faith alone without the Copartnership of VVorks, is the Condition of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61305:403"/> at first, but Faith and VVorks together of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication afterward. I have shewed some Reasons against it, but I can see none for it. Your Similitude of a Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no proof. Similitudes may illustrate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they prove nothing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You said, <hi>[The Apostle saith, That Faith did</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Work in and with his Works];</hi> whereas the Apostle using the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> did not speak of working in, but only of working with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of what validity that distinction is (of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Inchoated, and Justification Continued and Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) you have not yet shewed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. VVhat <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion otherwise was, is not to the purpose. I only alledged his Exposition of those words, <hi>Fides cooperata est operibus suis;</hi> and I think his Exposition is genuine.</p>
                  <p>So also Mr. <hi>Manton; [That sense which I prefer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">On <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 22.</note> (saith he) <hi>is, That his Faith rested not in a naked bare Profession, but was operative, it had its efficacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon his Works, co-working with all other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: it doth not only exert, and put forth it self in acts of Believing, but also in working].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, <hi>Administra fuit operum ejus,</hi> and expounds it, <hi>Essicax &amp; foecunda bonorum operum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shewed before how not only <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Pemble,</hi> but many others both before and after them, interpret <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 73.</note> those words, <hi>[By Works his Faith was made perfect]; i. e.</hi> By VVorks his Faith did appear perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> sound and good. This Exposition is such that as yet I see no reason to dislike it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I grant that Faith without VVorks <hi>(viz.</hi> when God doth require them) is dead as to the effect of Justifying; Yea, and it is also dead in it self, being but a dead As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, having no life, no operative vertue in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was, is, and shall be manifested to be perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> sincere by his VVorks, to all that were, are, and shall be able to discern the true nature of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith. Although there were none then that could discern this, (which yet is not to be supposed, <hi>Isaac</hi> was then of age to discern it, and so others of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family to whom the thing was known) yet to after-Ages the perfection of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith is made manifest by his VVorks, especially his offering his Son upon the Altar.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61305:403"/> And if God did say, <hi>[Now I know that thou fearest me,</hi> &amp;c.] why may it not be said, speaking of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that thereby <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and its Perfection appeared to God himself? Certain it is, that the VVork spoken of did proceed from Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. And therefore as the Effect doth shew the Cause to be perfect, so did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s VVorks (especially that of offering up <hi>Isaac)</hi> shew his Faith to be perfect. To the Second:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though Justifying Faith include in it three Acts, mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. yet there are but two of them properly and peculiarly Acts of Faith. For Seeing, or Knowing, the first there mentioned, is but presupposed unto Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this saith truly, (though it was little to <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The other two Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> Perswasion and Embracing, though distinct, yet are both comprehended in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I see no cloudiness in this, <hi>[Believing justifieth, not as it is our Act, but in respect of its Object];</hi> neither is this to speak darkness, except to a dark Understanding, which (I know) yours is not. But you know what is said of some, <hi>Faciunt nimium intelligendo, ut nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligant.</hi> VVhat is more vulgar with Divines (and those no vulgar ones neither) than to say, That Faith doth not justifie as it is a VVork of ours, but in respect of its Object, Christ, whom it apprehendeth, and by whom so apprehended, we are justified?</p>

                  <p>Divers others to this purpose have been cited before. Your Question <hi>[Why doth not the Object justifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Act?]</hi> is soon answered; Because the Act (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61305:404"/> is required on our part, <hi>Deo sic ordinante,</hi> (as the Author before-cited saith) That so the Object (Christ's Righteousness) may become ours unto Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: yet still it is in respect of the Object (Christ's Righteousness) that the Act (Believing) doth justifie. You darken my words, when you transform them thus, <hi>[It justifieth in respect to its Object];</hi> I say, [in respect of its Object], and so you first cited it. My meaning is this, It is the Object of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though as apprehended by Faith, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>I will add Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>'s words, which in sense are the same with mine, and there is little difference (as to clearness or cloudiness) in the Expression; <hi>[The Third Exposition</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Coven. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note>
                     <hi>is, That when Faith is imputed for Righteousness, it is not understood materially, as though the Dignity, Worth, and Perfection of Faith made us just; but relatively and in respect of its Object: that is, to us believing, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> sc. <hi>of Christ, is freely imputed, and by Faith we freely receive Righteousness, and remission of sins freely given of God. And therefore to say, Faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and Faith is imputed for Righteousness, are phrases equivalent. For Faith justifieth not by its merit or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but as an Instrument, and correlatively, that is, the merit of Christ apprehended and received by Faith, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth, not Faith, whereby it is apprehended and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unless it be by an improper speech, whereby the Act of the Object, by reason of the near and strict connexion betwixt them, is given to the Instrument].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What you have said before about Works perfecting Faith, hath been considered. Though Faith may save without manifestation, yet not except it be of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to manifest it self by Works, when God doth call for them.</p>
                  <p>You say, <hi>[Works do perfect Faith, ut Medium &amp; Conditio];</hi> you mean of Justification: but that Works are <hi>Medium &amp; Conditio Justificationis,</hi> you do not prove.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61305:404"/> The Tree and its Fruit are considered as distinct; <hi>ut Causa &amp; Effectum, non ut Totum &amp; Pars;</hi> and so the perfection of the Tree is only manifested by its Fruit. It is not therefore a good Tree, because it beareth good Fruit; but it therefore beareth good Fruit, because it is a good Tree.</p>
                  <p>For the Third: If Procreation (as you grant) do not perfect Marriage in its Essence, then it adds only an accidental perfection unto it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your Explication is indeed now more full, so that I can better see your meaning, yet still I am unsatisfied. For I do not conceive that Faith properly is our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but that whereby we embrace God's Covenant. Though a Covenant differ from a Promise, yet it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Promise. Now a Promise is <hi>de futuro;</hi> so that our reciprocal Promise, both of Faith and Obedience, I take to be our Covenant. Faith is in part the matter of the Covenant, but not properly the Covenant it self, and perhaps when you call it our Covenant, you only mean, that it is the matter of our Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I being there the Respondent, it was sufficient for me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> to deny, the proof did lie upon you. Yet nevertheless the Assertion <hi>(viz.</hi> Faith alone is the Condition of the Covenant, for so much as concerns Justification) is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved by those places, where we are said to be justified by Faith, and that without Works, <hi>viz.</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with Faith unto Justification. And for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Assertion, <hi>(viz.</hi> because Faith alone doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Christ's Righteousness) much hath been said of it before.

                  </p>
                  <p>You your self do sometimes say, That Faith hath in it an aptitude to justifie in this respect; only you deny, that this aptitude of Faith is sufficient, and say that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth justifie, because God in his Covenant hath made it the Condition of Justification. Now I also grant, That if Faith were not ordained to that end of God, its bare aptitude, or its being that whereby we apprehend Christ, would not justifie. Yet (I say) it appears by Scripture, That because Faith alone hath this aptitude to justifie, <hi>viz.</hi> by apprehending Christ, therefore God hath made it alone the Condition of Justification. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that we are said to be justified by Believing in, or on Christ, which imports an apprehending and receiving of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Repentance doth avail with Faith, yet are we justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by Faith, and not by Repentance, and that for the reason even now alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> because not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but Faith is the Hand by which Christ is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though Remission of Sins be ordinarily ascribed to Repentance, yet it is no where said, That Repentance is imputed unto us for Righteousness, as it is said of Faith. Repentance in some sense is precedaneous to Justification, Justifying Faith doth presuppose Repentance; yet Faith and not Repentance is made the Condition and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Justification, as being that which doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Righteousness of Christ, by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That though Faith only be the Condition of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at first, yet Obedience also is a Condition after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is often said, but never proved. I take Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both at first and afterward to be by the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us; therefore not by Obedience, but by Faith, by which alone we apprehend the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, that so it may be ours unto Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Certainly that was not the beginning of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61305:405"/> Justification, which is mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. Yet by that doth the Apostle prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and all must be, justified, not by Obedience, but by Faith only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith apt to produce good Works, is necessary to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> &amp; 74.</note> procure that first change, which makes us (in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) <hi>Justos ex Injustis.</hi> For if it be not such a Faith, it is dead, and of no force.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I hope you will not deny, but that being justified by Believing, every after Act of Faith doth find us justified; for you are against the Amission and Intercision of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Yet I confess, That the continuance of Faith is necessary to the continuance of Justification. So it must needs be, seeing we are justified by Faith; therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act of Faith may be said to justifie, as well as the first Act, because by after-Acts of Faith we continue justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <p>Works therefore do not concur with Faith unto Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation no more afterward than at first.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>I answer therefore, <hi>Ad</hi> 1. How do I contradict it by saying, [As it is begun, so it is continued by Faith?] What though there be divers Acts of Faith, yet still it is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61305:406"/> Faith, and Faith without the concurrence of Works, by which we are justified as well afterward as at first, which is all that I assert? Because a continued Act of Faith is requisite to the Continuation of Justification, doth it therefore follow that Works have a co-interest with Faith in the effect of Justifying?</p>

                     <hi>Ad</hi> 3. We are not to measure God's Covenant by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Covenants. God's Covenant doth reach further than to Justification; and more may be requisite for the enjoyment of those benefits which belong unto Justified Persons, than is requisite unto Justification.</p>
                  <p>Your Similitudes are no Proofs; and you still suppose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> that there is one Condition of Justification at first, and another Condition thereof afterwards; that though at first we are justified only by Faith, yet afterward by Faith and Works. But though Works are required of Justified Persons, as Fruits of that Faith whereby they are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet they do not therefore concur with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, which as it is begun by Faith only, so is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so continued. Your self observe, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. was not his first Act of Faith. So then he was justified before by Faith, and so was he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so afterward, even by Faith only, as the Apostle from that very place doth prove <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Therefore by Faith without Works <hi>(viz.</hi> as having a co-partnership with Faith in Justifying), <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified both at first and afterward.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do you think that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified from the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> guilt of those many sins, which he committed after his first Justification by his Works? <hi>Credat Judaeus:</hi> for my part I cannot but detest such Doctrine. I know no way whereby he could be justified from those sins, but by Faith in Christ, even as he was at first justified. Besides (as I noted before, and that as acknowledged by your self), <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified before he produced that Act of Faith spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and in the <hi>interim</hi> no doubt he committed some sins, yet still by Faith, and not by Works (as <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth) <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. You do but still affirm, without any proof at all, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Justincation could not be continued by

                  <p n="4">4. I think the Argument is good and sound, [Christ's Righteousness, whereby we are justified, is an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Righteousness; therefore our Justification is an everlasting Justification]. This alwayes presupposed, That this Righteousness of Christ be apprehended by Faith; for otherwise there is no being justified at all by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be just <hi>quoad praestationem Conditionis,</hi> is but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; 75.</note> to be just in some respect; and in some respect just even the most unjust may be. Yet it is true, This <hi>praestatio Conditionis</hi> will be of force to procure Universal Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: not that it is it self the Righteousness by which we are justified, but only the Means whereby we are made Partakers of the Righteousness of Christ, and so by his Righteousness are universally justified. And though this performing of the Condition be required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Justification, yet nevertheless that remains good which I said in the <hi>Animadversions, [If we be fully freed from the accusation of the Law, we are fully justified].</hi> For can we be fully freed from the Accusation of the Law, except we perform the Condition required in the Gospel? And if we be fully freed from the Accusation of the Law, will the Gospel accuse us? <hi>It is the Law that worketh Wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. The Gospel doth free from Wrath, though not without performing the Condition; for then it suffereth the Law to have its force, and to instict Wrath; and that so much the more, in that so great a benefit was neglected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The performing of a Condition, as the Condition is a Duty, is a Righteousness, but such as cannot Justifie,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61305:407"/> as we now speak of Justification. But as the Condition is meerly a Condition, the performing of it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Righteousness, though by it we partake of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteousness of Christ, by which we are justified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore this is no contradiction, to grant Faith to be the Condition of Justification, and yet to deny it to be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For here presently after you say, <hi>[This Personal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> praestitae conditionis N.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (as I have said before) this latter Accusation is but a further prosecution and confirmation of the former, by taking away the Plea that some might make why the Accusation of the Law should not stand good, and be of force to condemn them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of what force is Satans Accusation against any, if he cannot make good his Accusation, so as to procure his Condemnation? And are not Unbelievers and Rebels against Christ condemned by the Law? Is it not for sin that they are condemned? And is there any sin which is not against the Law? The Gospel indeed may aggravate Sin, and increase Condemnation: and so those words which you cite <hi>[The words which I speak shall judg you,</hi> &amp;c.] may be understood; as those are more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the purpose <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>If I had not com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. I think there is not the like right of Salvation and Justification, but that although we must be saved by Works, though not by the Merit of them, yet we cannot be justified by Works, except it be by the merit of them. My reason is, Because that whereby we are justified, must fully satisfie the Law; for it must fully acquit us from all Condemnation, which otherwise by the Law will fall upon us. This Works cannot do, except they be fully conform to the Law, and so be meritorious, as far forth as the Creature can merit of the Creator. But being justified by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Righteousness of Christ through Faith impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and so put into a state of Salvation, we must yet shew our Faith by our Works; which though they be imperfect, and so not meritorious, yet make way for the full enjoyment of Salvation. And me-thinks the Scripture is so frequent and clear in distinguishing betwixt Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation, as to the full enjoyment of it, that it may seem strange that you should so confound them as you do, and argue as if there were the same reason of the one as of the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You might easily see, that by <hi>[Via Regni]</hi> as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>[Causa Regnandi];</hi> I meant only to exclude the Merit of Works, not to deny Works to be a Means
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61305:410"/> and a Condition required of us for the obtaining of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Salvation. Salvation is a Chain consisting of many Links, but so is not Justification; it is but one Link of that Chain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If all the World of Divines be against this, That Justification at Judgment is but a Declaration of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification here; I have hitherto (it seems) been in some other World. For truly (so far as I observe) both Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Divines usually speak of Justification, as we here partake of it. As for Justification at Judgment, it is but rarely touched, either in Scripture or in other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: Neither (so far as I can see) will it consist with either, to make Justification at Judgment a compleating of our Justification, as if before we were but imperfectly justified: but rather they shew, that our Justification is then fully declared and made manifest, and that then we come to the full enjoyment of that benefit, which we have right unto by our Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> Glorification. <hi>For whom he justified, them he also glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30. I have spoken enough of this before; but you do so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repeat the same things, that I am forced also to repeat things oftner than I would.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Justification by Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Last <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Judgment, and Continued Justification, are several kinds of Justification distinct from Justification begun, and have several Conditions, you continually affirm, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but never prove.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My debate with you was about those words, <hi>[That which we are justified by, we are saved by];</hi> and <hi>[the full possession or enjoyment of Salvation].</hi> What your reply is to the purpose, I cannot see. And besides, you had need to clear those words, <hi>[In justifying it is the same thing to give a right to a thing, and to give the thing it self].</hi> For if you mean, That as soon as a right to a thing is given by Justification, the thing it self also is actually given; it appears to me far otherwise. For I think that Justification presently gives a right to Glorification; For what doth debar from that right, but sin? Now the guilt of sin is done away by Justification; therefore there is a present right too to Glorification, yet no present enjoyment of it. How I do yeeld your Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you do not shew.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:61305:411"/>
                  <p> Your Repetitions indeed have been troublesome unto <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> me. I grant here more than you desire, <hi>viz.</hi> That not only to morrow there will be Condemnation to him that shall not sincerely obey, but even to day there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to him; his Faith being not prompt and ready to bring forth the Fruit of Obedience, is not such as doth justifie him at all. But though Faith, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, must and will shew it self by Works, yet we are not therefore justified by Works as well as by Faith. <hi>Paul</hi> doth exclude Works, as well from Justification afterward as at first, <hi>viz.</hi> as concurring with Faith unto the Effect of Justifying: for he shews that <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aham</hi> was justified, not only at first, but also afterward, by Faith and not by Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3. And <hi>James</hi> doth require Works as well to Justification at first as afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> as Fruits of that Faith whereby we are justified. For otherwise he saith it is a dead Faith, ineffectual and unprofitable. Though Works do not presently appear upon our first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, yet it they do not appear in due season, that Faith doth not justifie: Such a Believer doth not cease to be, but indeed never was in Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> as a justified Person is in him.</p>
                  <p>How is Justification at Judgment a declaring of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in question? The Word of God (the truth whereof is unquestionable) assures us that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are justified. And that such and such were true Believers, God by his Word and Spirit did evidence unto them before, though then he will make it more fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto all! That Satan shall publickly accuse at the Last Judgment, is more than I see either Scripture o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet I question also whether Satan do at any time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly put up unto God any Accusations against the Saints. He seems to be called <hi>the Accuser of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Apoc.</hi> 12. 10. because by his Instruments he is ever <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> on the place.</note> traducing and slandering them.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61305:411"/> in <hi>Job</hi> 1. &amp; 2. seems to be parabolically expressed. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan knows his Accusations against the Saints to be false: Therefore he knows it is to little purpose to accuse them unto God. Especially at the Last Judgment, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry separating of the Elect from the Reprobate, he will see that it is in vain to bring any Accusation against the Elect: and therefore how there should then be any such publick Accuser, or any question of the Righteousness of the Saints, I do not see: besides, that excepting those who will be found alive at Christ's coming, all have received their doom before, though not so openly as then they shall. That Obedience is a Condition of Glorification, not of right unto it, but of possession and enjoyment of it, I here and every-where confess.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What mean you by those words, <hi>[Doth Obedience</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not said, That Obedience doth procure right, but only thus much is signified, That none can have right without Obedience, as the Fruit of that Faith by which right is procured. As I said before of Works, so I say now of keeping the Commandments, (which doth comprehend in it all good Works) it is spoken of only as a Fruit of Faith, which Faith indeed doth (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally and Relatively) procure Right.</p>
                  <p>For the words of <hi>James</hi> I have said enough before: I have neither list nor leisure to repeat the same things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon every occasion. What your multitude of other Texts is, I do not know; but if they be not more forced, than by my Opinion the words of <hi>James</hi> are, there will be little cause to complain of the forcing of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Faith without Obedience doth give right at first, you grant: The same right (I hold) is still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued only by Faith; though Faith, if not of such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as to produce Obedience, can neither give right at first, nor afterward continue it. Though Repentance must go before Justification, yet Faith alone may justifie, and so give right; which though it be not the same with Justifying, yet it is necessarily joined with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61305:412"/> 3. <hi>Jus in re,</hi> I take to be such a Right, as from which the Possession it self is not, nor can be separated.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Text doth not ascribe <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only <hi>Declarativè:</hi> as a Fruit of Faith it maketh it appear, that there is such a Right which Faith hath procured.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I do indeed believe, That a Man may have, and hath <hi>Jus ad Gloriam</hi> without Obedience, even as he is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Obedience. For certainly as soon as a Man is justified, he hath <hi>Jus ad Gloriam.</hi> For what doth hinder but sin, the guilt of which by Justification is done away? Yet still I say, Faith which doth justifie, and so gives right to Glory, will shew it self by Obedience. Those words <hi>[If he live to Age]</hi> are needless: for we speak conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of the Justification of such as are of Age. But how can you seriously ask me this Question, when your self put it out of all question, holding that a Man (that is of Age, I presume) is at first justified, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (as I think you will not deny) hath <hi>Jus ad Gloriam,</hi> by Faith without Obedience?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is no debasing of Faith to say, That after it, as a Fruit of it, Obedience is required to give <hi>Jus in re, i. e.</hi> to bring into the actual possession of Glory. How can you pretend this to be a debasing of Faith, who debase it much more in making it unsufficient to give <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> except there be Obedience concurrent with it? Though yet herein you do not keep fair correspondence with your self, without a distinction of <hi>Jus Inchoatum,</hi> and <hi>Jus Continuatum;</hi> which distinction how it will hold good, I do not see.</p>
                  <p>If any shall think that you have said enough to prove, That we are justified by a Personal Righteousness, I shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> think that such are soon satisfied.</p>

The non-fulfilling of the Condition of the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="79"/> doth condemn, yet it is by the Law, and for the transgressing of it that any are condemned; there being no freedom from Condemnation, but by the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor any by it without fulfilling the Condition of it. Such as do not embrace the New-Covenant, and that on the terms upon which it is made, are left to the Condemnation of the Old-Covenant, which will be so much the sorer, as the Sin in despising the Mercy offered is the greater. So that still (as I said in the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions)</hi> the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it for us, is that by which we are justified, though Faith be required of us, that Christ's fulfilling of the Law may be imputed unto us, and so we may be justified by it.</p>
                  <p>The Accusations which you speak of, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of not fulfilling the Condition of the New-Covenant. 2. Of having therefore no part in Christ. 3. Of being guilty moreover of far sorer punishment.</p>
                  <p>All these Accusations (as I have often said) are but a re-inforcing of that Accusation, That we are guilty of transgressing the Law, and so to be condemned; and therefore the more guilty, and the more to be condemned, because freedom from that Guilt and Condemnation might have been obtained, and was neglected; see <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38, 41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. You might see that I do not yeeld the Thesis, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you make Faith and Obedience so to be Conditions of the New-Covenant, as withal to be Conditions of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication▪ This both now and every-where I deny.</p>

That none should be saved by Christ, but such as are obedient unto him, that I see; but not that Obedience is that whereby we are (at least in part) justified.

                  <p>The Texts which you alledg speak only of Obedience: and so if you will think to prove by them, That Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="81"/> is the Condition of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts shew that Faith is the only Condition, and that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not concurrent with Faith unto Justification, though it necessarily flow from that Faith by which we are justified. That may be alledged as the reason of the Justifying Sentence, which yet is but the Fruit and Effect
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61305:417"/> of Justifying Faith. If <hi>Sententia</hi> be <hi>Praemii Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> then (I think) <hi>Causa Sententiae</hi> must be also <hi>Causa Praemii adjudicati.</hi> The word <hi>[For],</hi> when we say <hi>[Justified for Faith],</hi> must note either the formal, or the meritorious Cause: the <hi>ratio Sententiae</hi> may be drawn from that, which is neither the formal nor the meritorious Cause of Justification, nor yet a Condition or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, but only a Fruit and Effect of that which is so.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scripture doth not say, That Works do justifie us in that sense as you take it, <hi>viz.</hi> as joint Conditions with Faith of Justification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I think it not so proper to say, [We must be judged, and receive our Reward by our Works] as [according to our Works].

That which is the Condition of Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not therefore the Condition of Justification, or of right to Glorification, which doth immediately flow from Justification, or at least is inseparably joined with it.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed and <hi>James</hi> did not consider Works in the same sense.

The Scriptures do plainly so distinguish, as to deny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="82"/> Working, that thereby we may be justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. and 4. 5. Yet to asser, Working, that thereby we may be saved, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. You will say, That the former places speak of Meritorious and Legal Working.</p>
                  <p>But, 1. All Working which is good, is Legal, as I have shewed before, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Rule and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of the Law, even Gospel-Obedience is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Legal. And when the Apostle doth exclude the Deeds of the Law from Justification, he doth not mean (as some take it) Deeds done by the Power of the Law, without Grace, but Deeds which the Law doth prescribe however done. For he denies that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Works; yet doubtless they were not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle taketh it as granted, That all Works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are justified, are meritorious: for if there be no meritoriousness in them, he supposeth there is no being justified by them. For indeed how can Working justifie, if there be any defect and failing in it? Therefore Faith it self doth not justifie in respect of it self, but in respect of Christ whom it apprehendeth. See <hi>Calvin Inst. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 11. §. 7. the words were before-cited.</p>
                  <p>To your Second; I have always denied that there is the same reason of Salvation <hi>(viz.</hi> compleat) and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and have always held, That Justification at Judgment is but a manifestation of our present Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>To your Third; None is <hi>Reus Poenae,</hi> except he be <hi>Reus Culpae;</hi> and there is no <hi>Reatus Culpae,</hi> but by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing the Law, though it may be aggravated, and so the other, by the Gospel. But properly the not-fulfilling of the Condition of the Gospel, taking it merely as a Condition, and not as a Duty, doth not bring a new Guilt, but only leaves a Man in the old Guilt, with an aggravation of it, he having no benefit of the Gospel to free him from his Guilt, and being the more deeply guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that he neglected the Mercy which he might have obtained.</p>

For else we have here Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication it self, and not only a right unto it, though we have only a right to Salvation, and not Salvation it self; I mean in respect of the fulness and perfection of it. And though Justification and Salvation flow from the same Covenant, yet there is more required unto Salvation, than unto Justification by that Covenant: and so you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hold in respect of your first Justification.</p>

Surely my words of themselves, [Freedom from all sin in respect of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from all condemnation for sin] are far more perspicuous, than when you so multiply Distinctions to find out (forsooth) the meaning of them. For, 1. Is not [Freedom] more plain than [Liberation?] though they both signifie the same thing. 2. Can there be an Active Liberation without a Passive, or a Passive without an Active? If God free us, are we not freed? And if we be freed, doth not God free us? What need then to distinguish in that manner? If freedom relate to God, it is Active; if to us, it is Passive.

                  <p>This is the nature of that Faith which doth receive Christ as a Reconciler, to work through Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. May I not retort upon you, and say, When you have taught wicked Men, that Faith alone doth justifie at first, and they are willing to believe, will you perswade them that they are unjustified again, because Works do not follow after? For my part, I know no unjustifying of those who are once justified. You speak sometimes of being justified to day by Faith without Works, and of being unjustified to morrow, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the day after, except Works come in and help to justifie. But I say, Faith without a promptitude to Works doth not justifie at first; such as do not receive Christ as Lord, and do good Works, when there is opportunity, were never justified at all, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a true Justifying-Faith, which is never without Works, as the seasonable Fruits and Effects of it: Yet Faith both at first and last doth justifie without Works, as concurrent with it unto Justification. What you say of a willingness to receive Christ, is nothing. For I speak of a true actual receiving, which I say cannot be of Christ as Priest, except it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Yet in another sense he holds that Christ's Righteousness imputed to us, is the formal Cause of our Justification; the words were before cited.</p>
                  <p>And as others, so Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> speaks the very same <note place="margin">Ʋbi supra.</note> thing, saying, <hi>Justificamur per justitiam Christi, non personae, quâ ipse est vestitus, sed meriti, quâ suos we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit, nobis imputatam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for the principal thing intended in this Section of yours, Though wicked Men may be more ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ as their Justifier, than as their Ruler, (so you express it); yet it follows not, that the receiving of Christ as a Ruler, is that Act of Faith which doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. For the difficulty of a thing is no good Argument to prove the necessity of it, either at all, or to such a purpose.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My second Note was to this purpose, quite to take away the force of your Argument, and so (I think) it doth notwithstanding your Reply. For have we not God's means to overcome that aversness of nature, if the receiving of Christ as Lord do necessarily follow Pardon, as well as if it be a Condition of Pardon? When I make it a Fruit of Justifying-Faith to take Christ for Lord, I do not say but that Christ may at once be received both as Priest and as Lord, and so must, if he be so propounded; I speak of express propounding and receiving: But my meaning is, That though we be justified by receiving Christ as Priest, perhaps not yet hearing of him (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly) as Lord, yet that Justifying-Faith will also put forth it self to take Christ for Lord, when he is so set forth unto us.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d before we take Christ as Christ. For Christ is Christ as Priest, though not only as Priest. Indeed to receive Christ in respect of one Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, so as to refuse him in respect of another, were not to receive Christ as Christ: but that is not the Case as I do put it. And for the moral necessity of taking Christ as Lord, which you ask what it is, if it be not a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I suppose it may be morally necessary as a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and yet be no Condition of Justification. For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61305:422"/> can nothing be commanded, and so be morally necessary, but it must be commanded and be necessary to that end, that thereby we may be justified? Works are commanded, and so necessary, yet you hold them to be no Condition of our Justification at first, neither indeed are they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3. doth ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resragably prove.</p>
                  <p>Your Argument I thus retort, [He that is justified, is in a State of Salvation, and should be saved, if he so died. But he that hath Faith without VVorks, is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is in a State of Salvation, and if he so die, shall be saved]. Answer for your self as you please: for my part I say, The same Faith which receiveth Christ as Priest, and so justifieth, is ready also to receive Christ as Lord, when he is so propounded; even as that Faith, which justifieth, is ready to produce Works, when they are required.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You should not only suppose, but prove, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="84"/> excluding of Obedience from Justification (as co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Faith in justifying) is a Scandal given, and an Error.</p>

If <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his Doctrine were the same with this, his fellow-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants (I dare say) would not blame him for it.

                  </p>
                  <p>And among other reasons, Why all must repent and walk in newness of Life, he brings in this as the sixth; <hi>Subitus extremi judicii adventus;</hi> And cites that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>Manete in eo, ut cum apparuerit, fiduciam habeamus, &amp; non pudesiamus in adventu ejus:</hi> And that 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. <hi>Ipsi planè scitis, quòd dies ille Domini, ut fur in nocte, it a venturus sit: Cum enim dixerint, Pax &amp; tuta omnia, tunc repentinus eis ingruet interitus, sicut dolor partus multeri praegnanti, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>And for the next reason he brings in this; <hi>Poenae aeternae impoenitentium,</hi> citing Rom. 2. <hi>Juxta duritiam tuam, &amp; cor poenitere nescium, colligis tibi ipsi iram in die irae, quo patesiet justum judicium Dei, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>This (I think) is sufficient to shew that <hi>Illyricus</hi> (at least when he helped to write the Centuries) was as much for Obedience and good Works as either <hi>Bucer</hi> or <hi>Melancthon,</hi> for any thing that I see you cite out of them, and that he made them so Fruits of Faith, whereby we are justified, and have right to Salvation, that withal he made them Means or Conditions of Glorification; and more than this the words of <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> do not import.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say, that <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, which I cited, have nothing that you dislike, save only that Grace is said to be infused <hi>in ipso actu justificandi,</hi> which yet you shew how it is not to be disliked; you consider not for what end I cited those words, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew that all Protestants generally acknowledg and profess, (so he, <hi>Omnes enim agnoscimus, &amp; clarè profitemur)</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness doth go along with Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, though it be this and not that by which we are justified; and consequently, That Works are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61305:424"/> as Fruits of Faith, and Means of Salvation, though yet Works have no Copartnership with Faith in justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Neither <hi>Bucer</hi> nor <hi>Melancthon,</hi> nor any of our famous Divines that I know, did teach other Doctrine. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you seem to carry it so as if <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> had been of your Opinion; though what I have said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready may suffice to shew the contrary, yet I will add a little more.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. I am sorry to see you so bent to maintain what you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="85"/> have once done. Is it fair to take hold on a few words of an Author, and to pass by that which immediately followeth, and shew that he meant quite contrary to what is pretended? Is not this to make your self guilty of that which you accuse others of, <hi>viz.</hi> to take up some scraps against the meaning of the whole Book, and even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Page out of which you take them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I think nothing is more clear, than that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>'s words following those which you cited, gainsay your Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> of Works concurring with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. For he expresly saith, That Faith alone justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and that Works do but testifie and give proof, that Faith is lively.</p>
                  <p>Is not this the very thing that I so much contend for? And yet you stick not to say, That he yeeldeth Faith and Works to be the Condition of Justification, as if they were Copartners in this respect, whereas he ascribeth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification wholly to Faith, and excludeth Works from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any concurrence with it in justifying. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 70.</note> the place by you cited, he opposeth those who make Faith and Works the Condition, without which Remission cannot be obtained, and saith it is impossible to conceive how Faith and Works should be conjoyned as Con-causes in Justification, seeing Faith attributes all to Free-Grace, and Works challenge to themselves. And a little before that again he saith, <hi>[We read of two ways of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 69.</note>
                     <hi>by Faith, and by Works, but of a third manner, by Faith and Works both, as joint Causes, or Con-causes, we find nothing in Scripture].</hi> As he makes Faith to be more than a bare Condition, if by [Condition] be meant only <hi>Causa sine quá non,</hi> so do I: yet he doth use the words [Condition] and [Instrument] promiscuously, and doth sometimes call Faith the one way, sometimes the other. He supposeth also, That if Works concur with Faith unto Justification, they are Con-causes, and not such Conditions as are only <hi>Causae sine quibus non,</hi> as you seem to take it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You say that you allow of the Explicatory terms, as I judg them. Why? then you allow of this, [Faith
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61305:425"/> alone doth justifie]; yea, [as it embraceth the promise of free forgiveness in Jesus Christ]; for so immediately Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> doth explain himself. And for this very reason he denies Works to justifie, because <hi>[Works do not embrace</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 70.</note>
                     <hi>Christ]:</hi> Your distinction of Inchoated and Continued Justification, will here stand you in no stead. For besides that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> speaks of Justification simply considered, it's certain that Works neither at first nor afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concur with Faith in embracing the promise of for-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness in Jesus Christ: and therefore if Faith justifie in this respect, (as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> saith it <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>And</hi> p. 71. <hi>he proves it, because in Scripture every where Faith in Christ, in the Lord Jesus, or the Blood of Christ, is said to justifie, not Faith in other Promises, Threatnings, or Commandments.</hi>
                     </note> doth, and you seem to give your approbation of what he saith) surely both at first and afterward Faith alone doth justifie: though Works appear in their season, yet they do not concur with Faith unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which you cite out of Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> p. 20. doth not reach home to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. To say, as he there doth, <hi>[A dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to good Works is necessary to Justification],</hi> is no more than to say, A lively and working Faith, or a Faith apt and ready to Work, is necessary unto Justification. So when he saith, <hi>[Good Works of all sorts are necessary to our continuance in the state of Justification, and so to our final absolution, if God give opportunity];</hi> he meaneth only this, that Works are necessary Fruits of that Faith by which we lay hold on the Righteousness of Christ, and so are justified and absolved. <hi>[The Faith</hi>

B.) lay hold on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises once embraced. Actual good Works of all sorts (though not perfect in degree) are necessary to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Actual Justification, because Faith can no longer lay claim to the Promises of Life, than it doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rtually or actually lead us forward in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven].</hi> It is clear, that as well afterward as at first, he ascribes Justification only to Faith, as being only that which doth embrace the Promises, though he require a working Disposition at first, and Works themselves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61305:425"/> as opportunity serveth, to testifie and give proof that Faith is lively, <note n="*" place="margin">Of the Coven. p. 73.</note> as he expresly speaketh. The words which you further add, I have cited before, and they are directly against you, shewing that as I and others take the word [Condition] Faith is the only Condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and Works no part of it. And see what Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> addeth immediately after those words, <hi>[Faith and Works are opposed in the Matter of Justification, not that they cannot stand together in the same Subject, for they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably united, but because they cannot concur or meet together in one and the same Court, to the Justification or Absolution of Man].</hi> That which you cite from <hi>p.</hi> 21. is not to be understood (as you seem to take it) of actual walking, but of a disposition to walk, as he said <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>[A disposition to Works,</hi> &amp;c.] This disposition is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of that Faith, or always conjoined with that Faith, whereby we are partakers of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This plainly appears to be his meaning, both by the words immediately going before, and also by the words in the preceding Page, both which are already cited.</p>
                  <p>1. If Personal Righteousness be not perfect, but have <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> need of pardon for the imperfection of it, then there is no being justified by it. This very reason <hi>Luther, Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> give, why we cannot be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Inherent Righteousness, as I noted before out of <hi>Wotton de Recon. part</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>num.</hi> 4. And to this purpose I also have cited before the words of <hi>Calvin, Davenant, Amesius, Rivet</hi> and <hi>Maccovius.</hi> As for the Metaphysical Perfection of Being, which you speak of, it is but such as doth belong to things that are most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61305:426"/> first and afterward) justified, hath in it at first a readiness to Works, and afterward doth work, as opportunity is offered. <hi>Quìd commerita est Fides (inquit</hi> Maccovius) <hi>in progressu vitae, ut tantum non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, quantum in initio?

The truth of my Conclusion (I think I may well conclude) is firm and clear, <hi>viz.</hi> That according to <hi>Calvin</hi> (and so <hi>Bucer</hi> and all our famous Writers) Personal Righteousness i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> Repentance and Love to Christ are not excluded from our first Justification, yet have they no co-interest with Faith in Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Faith, not Repentance, or Love being <hi>Causa apprehensiva</hi> (as <hi>Bucer</hi> and other Protestants do speak) that which doth apprehend Christ's Righteousness, by which so apprehended we are justified. Neither is it denied, that outward Works are requisite, that we may continue justified here, and be sententially (solemnly and openly) ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified at the last Judgment: yet it follows not that Justification as continued and consummated at Judgment, is by Works, as concurring with Faith unto Justification.

I so confess Faith to be the Condition of Justification▪ that nevertheless I hold it to justifie as apprehending Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, God having in that respect required Faith of us, that we may be justified. And herein (as I have shewed before) I have Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> and other Judicious Divines agreeing with me, who call Faith a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Justification, and yet make it to justifie as it apprehendeth Christ and his Righteousness.</p>

For Christ's Righteousness justifying formally, or being the formal cause of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, I have shewed in what sense some of our Divines do hold it, and some reject it, and that the difference is rather in words, than in the thing it self. 3. To me it seems no obscurity to say, [Faith or Believing doth justifie, because Christ's Righteousness, except it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Faith, is not available to Justification]. Is not this as much as Faith doth justifie Instrumentally, or as apprehending Christs Righteousness by which we are justified? The reason why Christ's Righteousness cannot justifie, except it be apprehended by Faith, is this, That God doth require Faith of us; Faith (I say) apprehending Christ and his Righteousness, <hi>[Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ]</hi> that so we may be justified. God's Will is properly the Cause, yet there is a congruity in the thing it self, an aptitude (you grant) in the nature of Faith: it is of an apprehensive Nature, and its apprehending of Christ's Righteousness (the Will of God still presupposed) doth make this Righteousness ours, even as a Gift becomes ours by our receiving of it. If <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, which I cited, be not against you, then nothing that I can say is against you. For I cannot express my own mind, as to that point, more clearly and fully than he doth. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his words again; <hi>(De Justit.

Faith then is said to justifie, yet not in respect of it self, but in respect of its Object: it is not properly Faith apprehending, or the apprehension of Faith, but Christ and his Righteousness apprehended, by which we are justified. Much hath been said before to this purpose.

But do our greatest Divines give as much to Works as you do? This you will undertake (you say) to manifest. Why? then make it appear, that they hold Works to justifie as well as Faith, or to have a co-interest with Faith in the Effect of Justifying.

Their meaning is not obscure, as you pretend, that you may the better oppose it. The Object of Faith, Christ's Righteousness apprehended by Faith, doth justifie: and so Faith is said to justifie, not as considered in it self, but in respect of its Object, which it apprehendeth, because it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth that, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Righteousness which doth justifie. <hi>Ad</hi> 3.

                  <p>As to the first of these Differences, I would know, Whether it be about the <hi>Matter</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> that we disagree? If the <hi>Matter,</hi> then Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would never have granted, 1. That Faith and Obedience is an <hi>inherent</hi> or <hi>personal Righteousness,</hi> and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led commonly by Scripture and Divines. 2. That it is the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the <hi>Conditions</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> 3. That if we be <hi>accused</hi> to have <hi>no right</hi> in Christ, because we have <hi>not fulfilled</hi> this <hi>Condition,</hi> we must plead the <hi>actual fulfilling of it</hi> by our selves, or perish; and not plead any fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it <hi>by Christ</hi> for us, nor any <hi>pardon</hi> for our <hi>not fulfilling</hi> it. 4. Yea, that even wicked men may have a true <hi>particular Righteousness,</hi> (though not <hi>this</hi> which is the Condition of Salvation) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member now no one <hi>material</hi> difference left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
                  <p>And if it be only <hi>Verbal:</hi> 1. I conceive that the Dispute, <hi>[Whether the fulfilling of the Conditions of the New-Covenant may be called Righteousness, or we be said to be justified by it?]</hi> when we are agreed in the <hi>thing,</hi> is not worth the contending about. 2. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith, <hi>p.</hi> 91. of his Exceptions, <hi>Non oportet litigare de verbis cum de re constet.</hi> 3. He confesseth (as is said) that even a wicked Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate may have a <hi>particular Righteousness,</hi> and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s so denominating it.

                        </gap>e</hi> may be called <hi>righteous quoad causam particularem,</hi> and that that is <hi>Righteousness,</hi> me thinks should not deny it in our case. 4. He confesseth (for it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable) that all our Divines do give the <hi>name</hi> of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61305:433"/>
                     <hi>Righteousness</hi> to our <hi>inherent Righteousness:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>de nomine</hi> we differ not. 5. He denieth not (for it is past denying) that <hi>Scripture</hi> often calleth our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> by the name of <hi>Righteousness:</hi> So that when I so call it, I do but speak as the Holy Ghost hath taught me. Thus far then methinks, we should be fully agreed (as in sense so) that the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> is lawful and fit to be applied to our Faith it self, and personal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>It remains then <hi>de nomine,</hi> whether we may say, 1. Either that this <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> doth <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie us?</hi> 2. Or that we <hi>are justified by it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>former phrase.</hi> I use not to say <hi>[Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth:]</hi> 1. Because it soundeth as if I made it an <hi>efficient Cause.</hi> 2. Because Scripture rather useth the <hi>other</hi> phrase. <hi>[We are justified by Faith.]</hi> Though there seem small difference in these speeches, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the latter best sitteth the nature of a <hi>conditional</hi> or <hi>dispositive Interest:</hi> And the Holy Ghost is the fittest Judg.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61305:433"/> first blamed for, is not the misunderstanding of a particular Text, but of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is beyond all doubt a contradiction unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Pen of any Learned man to say, <hi>This is our Righteousness, and yet will not</hi> in tantum <hi>justifie us;</hi> (and <hi>in totum,</hi> I ever denied it as much as they:) <hi>Forma proculdubio informat &amp; denominat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To justifie,</hi> (in the sense I use it) is (first) <hi>to constitute Righteous,</hi> (for I take it for <hi>constitutive Justification</hi> first:) But it may be said, that we are <hi>constituted Righteous</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> (not speaking of <hi>universal Righteousness:)</hi> Therefore it may be said we are <hi>justified by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing can be said to this Argument, but against the <hi>minor,</hi> by denying that the word <hi>[Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie]</hi> is ever taken for <hi>constituting Righteous,</hi> but only for <hi>sentencing</hi> us so: But I never yet met but with one Learned man, that I remember, that was of that mind. Our Divines ordinarily distinguish of <hi>Justification constitutive and sentential:</hi> 1. His Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because it is still taken <hi>in sensu forensi,</hi> and so we maintain against the Papists. But I answer, Our Divines take not <hi>sensum forensem,</hi> as excluding, but including, <hi>sensum Legalem, vel Civilem</hi> (as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly speak) but only as excluding <hi>sensum Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> as it signifieth merely our acts and qualities of <hi>Ethical Justice</hi> or <hi>Virtue.</hi> Now so I grant against the Papists, that Justification signifieth not most usually nor very oft an infusion of new Qualities; but 1. <hi>Non reatum culpae vel poenae,</hi> which is Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and <hi>Legal Righteousness.</hi> 2. <hi>Sentential Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</hi> Now I say no more, but, 1. That our <hi>Non-reatus culpae finalis impoenitentiae &amp; infidelitatis</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61305:434"/>
                     <hi>aut Rebellionis,</hi> is our <hi>particular Righteousness or Justification.</hi> 2. Our <hi>Non-reatus poenae propter hanc culpam</hi> is founded herein as the <hi>matter.</hi> 3. Our <hi>Non-reatus poenae aeternae</hi> in general dependeth on this (at the last Judgment) as on a <hi>Condition.</hi> 2. I little doubt but Scripture (mentioning Justification by Faith) means it of <hi>constitutive Justification;</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> for ought I perceive, thinks so too, taking it and sentential Justification for all one.</p>
                  <p>If then we may be said to be <hi>[made Righteous]</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> then we may be said to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified</hi> by them: But the former is true; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Righteousness</hi> which makes not righteous, is a thing, never yet known, except it were only <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men justitiae sine re,</hi> and it were only equivocally so called. For <hi>Righteousness</hi> is a mere <hi>relative form,</hi> and therefore must make, that is, formally <hi>constitute</hi> the <hi>person righteous so far.</hi> Even as there is no existent <hi>Worthiness,</hi> that makes not <hi>worthy;</hi> or <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> that makes not <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>Ʋnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> that makes not so far <hi>unrighteous;</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that makes not so far <hi>good:</hi> I think none will contradict this.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61305:434"/> called;) which by reason of its exceeding Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (for so I am content to speak) will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie us of it self in Judgment: This consisteth <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choatively,</hi> or at first, of <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out external Obedience; afterward, of <hi>Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,</hi> and <hi>Obedience added.</hi> 2. The other <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> is <hi>meritoriously Christ's Satisfaction for our sin,</hi> and <hi>formally the pardon of sin it self,</hi> whereby the defaults of all our Faith, Obedience, and other Graces, together with all the sins of our lives, are remitted, or our <hi>jus ad impunitatem &amp; regnum.</hi> Our Faith or Obedience is none, no not the least part of this Righteousness of Remission, and right to Life: But yet Christ in granting his Act of Pardon or Grace, did <hi>except final Infidelity and Impenitency</hi> out of it: And therefore as he <hi>pardoneth</hi> none such, so his <hi>Righteousness</hi> of <hi>Remission</hi> alway supposeth concurrent our <hi>personal Righteousness</hi> (quâ talis, <hi>not to be remitted;)</hi> Christ never died to purchase us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for loving God, hating Sin, Repenting, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only for <hi>the sin</hi> that adheres to these in their deficiency or evil company. Why may not this much reconcile us?</p>
                  <p>Nay, Note these two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in his pleading for an imperfect Righteousness, so denominated from its Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law, <hi>page</hi> 68, 69. professeth, that <hi>[Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting for Righteous, and accounting just, is as much as justifying;]</hi> and that, <hi>[it is the New-Covenant that so accepteth our Works, as they are a sincere, though imperfect, Conformity to the Law as a Rule;]</hi> and that; <hi>[for his part he should say, that we and our actions are justified from the Law of Works,</hi> i. e. <hi>from the Condemnation of it.]</hi> Now is not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61305:435"/> here as much, or more by far, than I say for Works?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More: For I do not think that God's accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our Works, is a <hi>justifying</hi> them from the <hi>Law's Condemnation;</hi> but that they are <hi>unjustifiable,</hi> and still <hi>condemned</hi> by the Law, and that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was never of force to save <hi>mens Works</hi> from the <hi>Law's Condemnation,</hi> but only to save the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> Nay, that if the <hi>Works</hi> be not <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>person</hi> cannot be <hi>justified</hi> by Christ, but must be justified by his <hi>Works:</hi> For <hi>justified Works</hi> will <hi>justifie</hi> the <hi>person,</hi> so far as they are <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;</hi> and if the <hi>Works</hi> be <hi>not condemned,</hi> the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> cannot be <hi>condemned</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I intend not this as an Accusation of his Opinion; for I believe he meaneth soundly: But then at least consider, Whether this be not as much as I say?

Note also, That he gives it as the very sum of all his Answer on this point, that <hi>[our Faith (and Obedience)</hi> as an <hi>imperfect Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> is a <hi>particular Righteousness,</hi> and so it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth not; but as it is the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> it justifieth, and so it is no <hi>Righteousness.]</hi> Now it is here granted, that a <hi>personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is requisite to our <hi>Justification,</hi> though not as <hi>Righteousness.</hi> If Faith, which is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, be necessary, though not <hi>as</hi> our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but as a <hi>Condition;</hi> for my part I have all that I desire for substance in his Concession, that <hi>Faith justifieth as a Condition.</hi> The rest is but of the <hi>name:</hi> And of the name himself saith, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>The Question is not, Whether we be said to be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Works or Words</hi> (that he confesseth) <hi>but how and in what sense we are to be so justified: There is a particular Justification, and a declarative Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Thus we are justified by our Works and Words; but a full and formal Justification is only by Christ's Righteousness, through Faith imputed to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what Reason gives he through the whole, why Faith is no <hi>Righteousness</hi> as a <hi>Condition?</hi> He saith still, that <hi>[It is no new Accusation to be accused of non-performing the Conditions of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but a making good the former.]</hi> But it is most evidently a distinct subordinate <hi>Accusation</hi> towards the making good the first.

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>very Covenant</hi> is a Law, even the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misory part:</hi> I prove it, 1. God is so super-eminently and transcendently above us, and our absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, that we are not capable of entring into a strict Covenant (as among equals) but such as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipateth of the nature of a Law. We have so wholly our dependance on him, and good from him, that he can make no <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>favour,</hi> or for our <hi>good,</hi> but so far it must be as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> (it being otherwise with earthly Sovereigns, whose Subjects receive not all their propriety from them:) And also he is so conjunctly our <hi>absolute Sovereign,</hi> that he can enter no <hi>Contract</hi> with us but <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61305:437"/> 2. From the Definition: A Law taken most fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though largely (for <hi>jus Constituens,</hi> adequate to <hi>jus Constitutum;</hi> and not for <hi>Lex,</hi> as its narrowly taken as distinct from <hi>Precept, Priviledges, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi> &amp;c.) this true proper <hi>Law</hi> is but <hi>Constitutio debiti Authoritativa;</hi> or, <hi>Signum voluntatis Rectoris debitum Constituens.</hi> Now <hi>Constituere debitum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mii,</hi> is as true an Act of <hi>this Law</hi> (though <hi>every Law</hi> have it not, which made some exclude it;) as <hi>constituere debitum officii.</hi> Yea, acts of absolute <hi>free Grace</hi> or <hi>Pardon</hi> are <hi>true Laws.</hi> So that God did make the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> as <hi>Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Legislator</hi> both; and so gave the Legal <hi>jus ad Beneficium,</hi> and constituted the <hi>Condition</hi> of his own Gift.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides, I am not yet of Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s mind, that the <hi>Precept</hi> it self, which he calls the Law, is not a real part of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> What though it be part of the <hi>Law?</hi> so it may be, and of the <hi>Covenant too;</hi> for the <hi>Covenant</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> hath well shewed) is truly a <hi>Law,</hi> called a <hi>Covenant</hi> from the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent part (the <hi>Promise)</hi> and from God's Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention, and from man's requisite Consent: Yet called a <hi>Laws,</hi> as being the <hi>authoritative Constitution</hi> of what shall be <hi>due to us</hi> (good or evil) and what shall be <hi>due from us</hi> for the obtaining of one, and escaping the other. But of this more anon about the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, as Unrighteousness condemneth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, as it is contrary to <hi>Duty,</hi> but as it is contrary to the <hi>Condition of Life,</hi> and is the Condition of the Threat: So when it concerneth Judgment, the word <hi>Righteousness</hi> doth most nearly belong to Duty as a Condition, and remotely to Duty as Duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61305:437"/> 2. The second Question or Point of Difference, <hi>[I make Works to have a co-interest with Faith in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how? It is sure confessed not in our <hi>first Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> and that it is principally in our last great Justification at Judgment. Do I advance Works higher than others? or do I not rather seem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Faith lower? I never made Works to be the the <hi>instrumental Cause</hi> of Justification, as others do <hi>Faith.</hi> I never made them the <hi>causa applicans,</hi> as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> makes Faith. I never made them <hi>any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cause.</hi> I do aver in the end of my Answer to him, that I give <hi>less to Faith,</hi> but <hi>no more</hi> to <hi>Works</hi> than others.</p>
                  <p>His Answer is this: <hi>[Why? then make it appear that they hold Works to justifie as well as Faith, or to have a co-interest with Faith in the effect of justifying: Except you perform this (which I presume you never will) you cannot make good your undertaking.] Ans.</hi> I have proved over and over, that they affirm <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> a <hi>Condition</hi> of Pardon; and <hi>Obedience</hi> a <hi>Condition</hi> of final <hi>Justification.</hi> If I prove that they do thus, and that I do no more, do I not prove that I give no more to Works than they? What, must I prove that they give <hi>no more</hi> to Faith, and <hi>so</hi> make <hi>no greater inequality</hi> than I, before I can prove that they give <hi>as much to Works?</hi> The co-interest of a Condition I can prove by forty of them, that they give as far I: But must I prove that they give <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> the co-interest of <hi>a cause,</hi> which I deny my self?</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61305:438"/>
                  <p> So I did in the next lines cite <hi>Davenant,</hi> saying the very same words as I, and as fully as I desire, and largely explaining and proving them. Yet <hi>Davenant</hi> said well, and I say ill, when I am ready to subscribe to his words in the sense as they must plainly import, or with a Protestation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them as rightly as I can: If this be not <hi>non ex fide personas, sed ex personis fidem,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Tertul.</hi> what is?</p>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Doth not he say, that they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>[ut conditiones praecursoriae?]</hi> If they are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones,</hi> they have the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>Conditions</hi> in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. I say not, <hi>[They justifie us,]</hi> because that phrase sounds as if I ascribed an <hi>efficiency</hi> to them; but only, that <hi>[we are justified by them as Conditions.]</hi> And to say, [It is a Condition of Justification, and yet we may not be justified by it as by a Condition] is no better than to say, [Such a thing is an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but causeth not as an efficient.] I deny them to be <hi>Causes</hi> as well as he.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And what if you proved that he makes Faith <hi>a Cause,</hi> when I do not, and so doth not so nearly equal them as I? Doth that prove that I give <hi>more to Works</hi> than he? or rather that I give <hi>less to Faith?</hi> He that will affirm, that he ascribeth no more to Works than you, is but sorrily confuted by your saying, that he ascribeth <hi>less to Faith,</hi> that is, that he gives Works a <hi>co-interest</hi> with Faith: Which he may do, by derogating from <hi>Faith</hi> (or from your estimation of it) without adding any further dignity or power to Works.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> gives this as his summary Answer, <hi>[Your first inference is of no force, as having no ground,</hi> viz. <hi>that if I will be of</hi> Davenant<hi>'s mind, I must be of yours.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> If ever words were spoke against most <hi>express evidence in terminis,</hi> I think these are; 1. That my words were groundless, when I have no fitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of my own mind, than in <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words. 2. I hold not, <hi>[that they justifie,]</hi> but that <hi>[we are justified by them,]</hi> which phrase better fits a mere Condition than the former. 3. I take the words of <hi>James</hi> to be Scripture; and doth it prove, that I give more to <hi>Works</hi> than <hi>Davenant,</hi> because I cite the express words of Scripture? What if I misunderstand that Scripture? doth it follow that I give more to Works? 4. Is this an Argument to ground your Accusation on [Davenant <hi>makes Faith to justifie, as apprehending and applying Christ's Righteousness: Works cannot so do?]</hi> What then? <hi>therefore</hi> Davenant <hi>gives less to Works than you?</hi> A sorry consequence! Or is it, <hi>[Therefore</hi> Davenant <hi>makes not Works to justifie.] Answ.</hi> Nor I, if you take it efficiently, as you say, <hi>Davenant</hi> doth make <hi>Faith a Cause.</hi> But, 1. Is not this his giving <hi>more to Faith,</hi> and not <hi>loss than I to Works?</hi> 2. Doth he not say, that Works are Conditions of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some <hi>precursory</hi> and <hi>concomitant,</hi> and some for <hi>continuing it?</hi> And I still profess, that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by them but as <hi>Conditions.</hi> If you say, I call them <hi>Righteousness</hi> by which we are justified, I have answered that before; that is <hi>lis de nomine,</hi> and I so call them but <hi>à posteriore,</hi> because they are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61305:439"/> of our <hi>Justification,</hi> and you and <hi>Davenant</hi> call them <hi>a particular Righteousness</hi> as well as I. I still say, as to our <hi>universal Justification,</hi> they have no further interest than the very <hi>essence</hi> of a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imports;</hi> and if <hi>Davenant</hi> give them not this, he was to blame to tell us otherwise. 5. I make Faith also to justifie <hi>[as Apprehending and Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,]</hi> if you do not take the word <hi>[As]</hi> strictly <hi>pro ratione formali,</hi> but as signifying Faith's <hi>special aptitude</hi> to a preheminence in this Work: And I affirm, that <hi>Works</hi> do <hi>not justifie</hi> as <hi>Apprehending</hi> or <hi>Applying:</hi> (still remember, that when I use the phrase <hi>[Faith justifieth,]</hi> I use it in Conformity to your Discourse, and mean it as is before explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 6. Do not I say, as well as he, that <hi>opera se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur Justificationem &amp; praecedunt Glorificationem?</hi> and doth it thence follow, that he was unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my distinction of Justification <hi>Inchoate and Consummate</hi> at <hi>Judgment?</hi> Why? 1. You know the same man was acquainted with the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Justification Inchoate and continued.</hi> 2. And that that he saith <hi>Works follow Justification,</hi> makes them <hi>precursory Conditions</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of its <hi>Continuance?</hi> and so plainly acquaints you, that it is those <hi>external Works,</hi> which he makes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of <hi>continuing Justification,</hi> which he saith, <hi>follow</hi> it; which no doubt but they do. 3. Think you then, that this Learned man did not know, that Christ would come again to judg the quick and the dead? and so could distinguish between Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter?</hi> Or did he ever dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The sum of my Reply to this Question is this: 1. <hi>I never gave Works a co-interest with Faith, in causing or effecting our Justification:</hi> For I never gave <hi>Faith</hi> such an <hi>interest.</hi> 2. I never gave <hi>Works</hi> an <hi>equal interest</hi> with Faith. 3. I never gave <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Works any interest</hi> in our <hi>first Justification.</hi> Only to that I require, that the Faith be such as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himself so much pleads for, <hi>A working Faith,</hi> or <hi>non renuens operari;</hi> or that hath Works in it <hi>Virtually,</hi> (as taking Christ for King to be obeyed.)</p>

                  <p>I understand my own term partly, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not his: What Cause is this <hi>Causa applicans?</hi> As far as I understand him, he meaneth an <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cause:</hi> And that which is an <hi>efficient,</hi> may be said to <hi>effect.</hi> Here is the difference then, I do not make Faith to <hi>effect</hi> the <hi>pardon of any sin,</hi> that is, <hi>to pardon me</hi> (as a less principal Cause:) But had Mr. <hi>C.</hi> given us this <hi>Causality of Faith</hi> in any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion familiar to us Logicians of the lower Form, we should better have known what to make of it. In the mean time should I presume but to pass my Conjecture which of the sorts of <hi>Efficients</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, perhaps I might wrong him by my mistakes; yet let these two things be remembred: 1. That I hereby give <hi>less to Faith,</hi> but not <hi>more to Works.</hi> 2. That I only <hi>excuse my self,</hi> for not calling Faith,

Whither will not a man's partiality carry him, if he be let alone? May you not as well say, that Christ made some their own Saviours, because he said, that their Faith had saved them? I had thought that all the glory did belong to the principal Agent, rather than to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Where I have offended God in wronging men, I desire and hope for pardon. Yet if I may give a true account of my words, I must say, 1. That I would have you review, whether it be you or I that broke the Ninth Commandment. I did not say, that these Divines do make man his own Justifier; but only that <hi>[I give not to Faith, and so to man so much as they, not daring to make man his own Justifier.]</hi> I am afraid <hi>I should be guilty</hi> of this, if I said, that Faith effecteth our Justification: Doth it follow that I say, <hi>They are guilty of it?</hi> I think not, for all your anger. For Consequences are not to be fastened upon men that disown them, at least, as <hi>directly</hi> guilty of them: <hi>I see them,</hi> or seem to my self so to do; it would therefore bring that guilt <hi>on me,</hi> if I held their opinion, though it may not on them (unless remotely.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I never once thought of charging the men as holding, that they justifie themselves; but only I charged <hi>their opinion</hi> with it consequentially. And must the Reverence of men prohibite us to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or intimate the ill Consequences of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes? Then hath the Serpent got the day, when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61305:441"/> he hath once lodged his errours in Reverend breasts: It will be no more lawful to disturb him, if he be once so housed. Who is he that liveth, and erreth not? What errour in Morality hath not absurd and vile Consequents? If we <hi>mention</hi> them, it seems we are <hi>given up</hi> to a lamentable state of sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I now understand why you heap up the words of some <hi>late Reverend Divines,</hi> which I thought did make up <hi>utram{que} paginam</hi> in your Exceptions; and though themselves might receive a fair Answer, yet did seem your most irrefragable Argument. But if this be so, it's vain to dispute any more: For if I bring Scripture or Reason, you may say, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are against it. If I argue against their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by shewing their absurdities, you may say, What <hi>professed Adversary</hi> could <hi>reproach them more?</hi> It's <hi>too gross</hi> to charge Absurdities or ill Consequents on a Doctrine that such men hold. Then must mistakes dare us and deride us, when they are got into these holts, we can follow them no further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What say you by <hi>Amesius,</hi> that saith, That there is such a Concatenation of Truths, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denies one, and holdeth one errour, doth by Consequence overthrow the Foundation? <hi>Cas. Cons.</hi> I am not of his mind, unless it be limited to some kind of Truths: But it seems then he thought, that consequentially <hi>every errour</hi> denied Christ the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: How far was this man given up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, not only the late Reverend Divines, but all men living? far more than I.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. M. <hi>C.</hi> thinks that Christ's <hi>active Righteousness</hi> in obeying the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is not <hi>imputed</hi> to us for our <hi>Righteousness.</hi> I suppose his Reason is much drawn from several Absurdities or ill Consequents
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61305:442"/> which he thinks will follow, if the contrary be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted: Perhaps, that it will make Christ's death needless or vain; (for those that say as he, do charge it with no less.) Must I therefore lament the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> as one left of God, to reproach all those Churches and Divines that are against him, as bad as their professed Adversaries do? and say▪ He makes them deny the death of Christ?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If I must believe as the Church believes, which Church is it? why am I not as excusable for being loth to reproach the Church of Christ for 1200, if not 1400 years after Christ (who never made Faith <hi>the Instrument</hi> of <hi>justifying,</hi> that I could yet find) as accusable for reproaching some part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Europe</hi> for 150 years, by declaring the Reason of my dissent from the ill Consequence of their Opinions? If we must go to the <hi>Poll,</hi> neither you nor I shall be well pleased; if to the <hi>Ballance,</hi> to weigh the Authority of Divines, where dwells he that must hold the scales?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Either we may charge <hi>Consequences</hi> on the owners of mistakes, or not: If not, then how come I to be charged with this hainous crime; which can be no way made good, but by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Consequence? If we may, then <hi>I might do it;</hi> which yet I did not on the <hi>men,</hi> but their <hi>Opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. If this Consequence follow not their Doctrine, then disprove it. My proof is this: [He that saith, The act of my Believing is the efficient Cause of my Justification, doth consequently say, that I justifie my self: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore.] The <hi>major</hi> is plain, in that, [If the act be an <hi>Instrument,</hi> it is the <hi>Agents Instrument:</hi> But I am the Agent; therefore.] And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61305:442"/> if I do by this <hi>Instrument</hi> produce the effect, then I do pardon my self, for that's the effect.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. You say, <hi>[Whither will a man's partiality car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, if he be let alone?]</hi> 1. That <hi>Partiality</hi> was the cause either you <hi>do know,</hi> or you <hi>do not.</hi> If you <hi>do not,</hi> according to my simple Opinion, you should not have so sentenced: If you <hi>do know it,</hi> then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>directly</hi> by seeing my <hi>heart</hi> from <hi>York</hi> hither; (which I will not suppose you to pretend to:) Or else by some certain <hi>sign.</hi> Suppose you have signs of my reproaching our Divines, yet prove by your signs that I did it through <hi>partiality:</hi> I say again, <hi>prove it.</hi> 2. If it were from partiality, then it is by siding with some <hi>other party</hi> against you, whom I prefer before you: That party is either my self alone, or <hi>some others.</hi> If others, who be they? Papists or Protestants? or who? I know no party on Earth that I prefer before them, or equal with them (which I speak on supposition that I know my own heart as well as you do.) If it be my self, then the Charge is much higher: But the prover must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. To value my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before so many, and such men, and thence so to reproach them, I confess is a hainous crime: where I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified. But surely, if I do know my own heart, I am partial in all my studies, for those men whom I am charged to be partial against, even against my self, and all others now living: But the light of appearing-Truth is that which forceth me to differ from them; and if I am mistaken, I have not yet learned a remedy. But certain I am, that partly <hi>partiality for these</hi> Reverend men, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the lothness to incur their censures, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61305:443"/> lothness to occasion their offence and disquiet, have been so strong a temptation to me to shut my eyes, that I have been sometimes provoked to say, <hi>[Depart from me; this knowledg is an ungrateful bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, an offence to my dearest Friends, and makes men take me as a man of Contention:]</hi> sed vicit veritas, (if I mistake not.)</p>
                  <p>I think he that considers, 1. That you have <hi>that party</hi> on your side who are a stronger temptation to partiality than any party (besides Christ, his Truth, and the same men in other things,) that I have to sway me against them. 2. And that you so much <hi>use their words,</hi> where I conceive better Arguments are wanting, may perhaps see cause to put it again to the enquiry, Who is more likely in this Cause to be partial?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for your inference from Christ's words, <hi>[Thy Faith hath saved thee.]</hi> I reply, 1. Christ did not say, that I can find, <hi>[Thy Faith is the efficient instrumental cause of thy Salvation,]</hi> nor I think any thing equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent: For I suppose he intended no more than the interest of a <hi>Moral Condition;</hi> if you take it to be spoken of saving him from his <hi>disease,</hi> or from the <hi>guilt</hi> of sin. But if you can prove, that it was spoken of saving him from the <hi>power</hi> of sin by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sanctification, then I will yield, that their Faith was some cause. 2. So far as a man is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of his own Salvation, I think he may properly be called his own <hi>Saver:</hi> Men are called in Scripture the Saviours of others; why not as truly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they are said to save themselves? If it be unfit (as it is) to use the word <hi>Saviour</hi> in this sense, of a mere man, the Reason is not from any Logical unfitness (unless that so full a name should
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61305:443"/> not be unlimitedly given to him, that is the cause of one part of Salvation, and not the rest;) but it is, because it will be justly offensive, now Christ hath made this his proper name. But can you prove, that man doth as truly <hi>pardon himself,</hi> as he doth <hi>reform himself</hi> further by Faith? and so that Logically there is no more against calling him his <hi>own Pardoner</hi> or <hi>Justifier,</hi> than <hi>[the saver of himself from actual sin.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">11. You say, you <hi>[had thought all the glory had belonged to the Agent, and not to the Instrument.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. We were not speaking of the <hi>glory,</hi> which is a <hi>Moral Interest</hi> (where spoke I a word of that?) but of the <hi>Natural Efficiency.</hi> 2. I never was of your mind, nor ever shall be I think. I know as the creature compared to God is <hi>nothing,</hi> so its honour compared to his is <hi>nothing;</hi> and I know its honour, as well as its essence and existence, is all derived from God. But I think God puts an honour upon every Instrument that he useth, and most in their best and noblest Works. Proved, 1. The <hi>Relation to God,</hi> the <hi>principal Agent,</hi> puts an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on it, to be <hi>Instrumentum Dei.</hi> 2. The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>happy effect,</hi> puts an honour on on it. 3. Every Instrument hath an <hi>Aptitude</hi> to its office, and that <hi>Aptitude</hi> is honourable. 4. All <hi>free Agents</hi> have a <hi>Moral honour</hi> in being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to any good, in that they act it <hi>voluntarily.</hi> 5. God will <hi>commend</hi> the <hi>Moral actions</hi> of his people, that were but mere <hi>Conditions</hi> of the effect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore surely those that were <hi>Instruments:</hi> And Gods <hi>commendation</hi> doth both suppose them <hi>honourable,</hi> and <hi>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. But if it must be as you say you thought it to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61305:444"/> yet I pray you remember to do me this right, as when-ever I give <hi>more to Obedience,</hi> or <hi>less to Faith</hi> than you would have me, do not charge me with derogating from the <hi>honour of Faith,</hi> seeing <hi>no glory</hi> is due to it as an <hi>Instrument!</hi> And if I do give less to Christ than you, tell me of it, and spare not.</p>
                  <p>He next asks, <hi>[Whether they that make Faith an Instrument, do deny any more than I (who make both Faith and Works Conditions) that none but God can forgive sins?]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I think they do deny it more than I. I confess they do not make man the <hi>principal Cause;</hi> but in making him the <hi>Instrumental,</hi> they make him as an <hi>Instrument under God</hi> to <hi>pardon himself,</hi> I think. The effect may be ascribed to every Cause, according to the nature and proportion of its Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality: But <hi>Conditions</hi> are <hi>no Causes</hi> as such.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You make both <hi>Faith and Works Conditions</hi> of <hi>Salvation; i. e.</hi> Glorification: And is not that as much against the honour of Christ, as making them the Conditions of Justification in Judgment? If it were true, that one were dishonourable to him, it would be as true of the other; but is indeed true of neither.</p>
                  <p>Here I remember the like great offence that you took before at these few words [James <hi>took not</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<hi>'s counsel;]</hi> when you had said, Calvin<hi>'s coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel was not to use the phrase, of being justified by Works.</hi> And you say, that <hi>[it contains nothing but a taunt against</hi> Calvin, <hi>and that it's unworthy usage of so Reverend a man.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Truly, I do reverence scarce any name, since the Apostles days, or at least since <hi>Austin,</hi> more than <hi>Calvin</hi>'s: And there was not in me, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61305:444"/> I know of a taunting intent; nor do I see any thing in those words that contain such unworthy usage as you express. The words signifie but this, [James <hi>his practice was contrary to the counsel that</hi> Calvin <hi>there gives, not to use the terms, of being justified by Works:]</hi> I thought the Emperor or the Pope would have endured as hard language as this. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am, the greatest persons in honour Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Civil that ever I knew, would not have taken it for such unworthy usage (as far as I can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by their making lighter of far worse.) Truly I fear, that this extream high expectation of such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Honour in the Ministers, is the great thing that threatens our calamity: When the example of the fall of the Roman Clergy by <hi>Luther,</hi> hath no more humbled us.</p>
                  <p>After this again, you bid me, <hi>[put not off</hi> Calvin <hi>with a taunt, as I did before.]</hi> But I have said more to these by-pages than I thought to have done.</p>
                  <p>The sum of all is this, I understand not what Cause it is that you call <hi>Causa applicans,</hi> till you tell me. But I verily think that you are of my mind, and do not know it, and that you mean with Dr. <hi>Twisse causam dispositivam</hi> (for so he oft saith, Faith is of Justification;) which is but <hi>Dispositio Recipientis,</hi> and is part of the subjective material Cause, and no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at all; some call it a passive receiving.

                  <p>Thus it is <hi>Lex stricta dicta.</hi> It is called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, partly as God doth, as it were, engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: (And so the mere Promise is a <hi>simple</hi> Covenant) partly as he requireth <hi>man's Promise or Consent</hi> to the terms (and so it is a <hi>propounded</hi> or <hi>tendered</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-mutual;) and partly as man doth <hi>actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise</hi> and engage himself to God, and accept the terms of God's Covenant: (And so it is an actual, mutual Covenant or Contract.)

                  <p n="3">3. God's Laws are specified from their <hi>matter,</hi> thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Precept:</hi> God hath a Law (or had) whose matter was <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-described:) And he hath a Law, whose mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is <hi>Repentance</hi> for <hi>Imperfection, Faith</hi> in him that <hi>restoreth</hi> us from sin, and <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> for the <hi>future</hi> to God-Redeemer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As from the matter of the <hi>Promisory</hi> part: So God had a Law made to <hi>Adam,</hi> which as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do think, and it is very probable) did promise <hi>Adam</hi> not only Immunity from God's Wrath, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also a <hi>Celestial Glory</hi> afterward, in case of his perfect Obedience. God hath now a Law, by which he promiseth to <hi>give Christ himself</hi> to be our <hi>Head, Husband, and Lord, and Saviour,</hi> and with him <hi>Remission, Adoption, Justification,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Redeemer, and a <hi>Glorification</hi> with our Head, where we shall for ever praise him that hath redeemed us to God by his Blood, and made as Kings and Priests to God; and in order thereto, that he will by degrees take off our sin by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and our penal misery by Preservations,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61305:448"/> Deliverances, Consolations, and at last by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and final Absolution. These things were not the matter of the first Promise.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the <hi>Threatning,</hi> (though some say that the <hi>New-Law</hi> hath <hi>no threatning:</hi> yet) 1. God's Law <hi>purely Moral,</hi> 1. Did threaten to man in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, <hi>Death</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> which contained the loss of God's Favour and Spirit, and of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent felicity, and his hopes of what was promised for the future; together with the pains and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his body, and everlasting pains (at least) to his Soul: Which pain would much consist in the gripes of Conscience for his not-continuing his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and in the sense of his misery in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Loss. 2. The same Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> called <hi>Moral,</hi> as still <hi>continued to faln man,</hi> doth <hi>threaten</hi> upon every further Transgression, the <hi>increase</hi> of our foresaid misery (so far as we are capable subjects;) and doth by <hi>more renewed Obligations,</hi> bind on us the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, It is very false: If they had but an <hi>offer</hi> of, it and <hi>conditional Promise</hi> (specially so free and sure a one) and were put into a <hi>possibility</hi> of it, and a way to attain it, so that their own refusal only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth them of it (or their Impenitency and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude) this is properly a Privation and a Penalty: Though it's true, according to their Doctrine that deny Christ's general Satisfaction, and that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased to all men a possibility of recovery, it would be no punishment to miss of it, as being but a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> and no <hi>Privation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Also and most principally from the <hi>matter</hi> of the several <hi>Conditions</hi> of the penal and premiant Acts, are God's Laws specified and distinguished. The <hi>Condition</hi> of the first Threatning, was the <hi>least particular</hi> sin; the Condition of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the New-Law, is only <hi>final Impenitency, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61305:449"/> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the Lord that bought us, in respect to the penalty of everlasting wrath and death: But lesser sins are oft punished with some withdrawings of the Spirit of Grace, and some sense of God's displeasure, and temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fictions. The Condition of the Promise of the first Law was perfect obedience, without the least sin: This is now ceased (though Mr. <hi>G.</hi> deny it); for, 1. The matter of the Condition now would be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliter impossibile:</hi> man having once sinned, it is <hi>impossible</hi> he should be perfect, and that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n intolerable conceit for us to conceive, that God of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fers life to sinners, on condition that they be not sinners; and that he hath a Covenant in this form. <hi>[If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now I add for Comparison: The Condition of the Covenant, or Promise of the Law of Grace, is <hi>Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience,</hi> which much differs from the <hi>former Condition.</hi> Of this more fully anon.

That therefore the Law of God, as <hi>Creator</hi> is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed or abrogated by the Law of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but is superadded, and that in a certain Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it. 3. That yet the said Law of <hi>Creation</hi> stands not now alone (as God's right of Creation to the Government stands not alone, but conjunct with his right of Redemption:) And therefore, 1. The <hi>Threatening</hi> is not now <hi>remediless</hi> as then it was, but conjunct with, and potentially or virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally destroyed by the remedying Law. 2. And therefore the <hi>Precept</hi> is not now to the same <hi>ends only,</hi> or <hi>wholly</hi> as before the fall: The <hi>immediate end</hi> indeed is the <hi>same,</hi> that is, that man be obliged to Duty to his Creator; but remotely there is this change, the end is not now to retain perfect man in his perfection, nor to keep him from falling from his first felicity, or forfeiting his right to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that Covenant: And the immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining end, remaineth not alone: For the Law of Nature is not now only to oblige us to obey the Creator, but also the Redeemer: And it is also to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61305:450"/> be the Rule of our sincere Obedience, which is the Condition of our Salvation: So that now the Law of Nature (or the Moral Law) is the Law of God as Creator and Redeemer both: For all things are delivered into the hands of Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Laws. As if the Subjects and Laws of a Nation of pardoned Rebels, should by the King be delivered to his Son as their Governor, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their pardon: So that there are no Laws in the World now but the Redeemers Laws. But yet we must still observe a wide difference between his Law of Grace, which is proper to <hi>God-Redeemer</hi> as Redeemer; and this remnant of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>which the Redeemer found the sinner under when he redeemed him,</hi> and which was with the sinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to him, partly still to oblige the sinner to duty, partly to oblige him to punishment, that so he might be a fit subject for the Law of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose very nature is to be a <hi>remedying Law,</hi> to dissolve the obligation of the former.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God's Laws also are specified, or at least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified by the different <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>sign.</hi> And so some Laws of God consist in his Revelations by the mere <hi>Works of Nature, within us, and without us,</hi> in which we may read much of God's mind; the invisible things of God being seen in the things that are made, so far as to leave men without excuse. This is now commonly called the <hi>Law of Nature:</hi> Other Laws God hath revealed by Works indeed, but it is <hi>supernatural Works:</hi> And so Christ's Life, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, giving the Spirit, were a real Law to the World that could know them: For they were signs of God's Will <hi>de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito Credendi,</hi> &amp;c. Other Laws God hath revealed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61305:451"/> by word of mouth, others by Inspiration, others by Writing; which are now his principal standing Laws, adjoyning to that of Nature (and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its matter.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God's Laws are divers, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers states of the subject. And so God's first Law was to <hi>innocent Man</hi> in his <hi>Friendship,</hi> and in some felicity. God's <hi>remedying</hi> Law of Grace (yea, and his remnant of the pure Morals) is made to <hi>man faln:</hi> But with this difference; The <hi>Morals as such,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to oblige man <hi>qui peccator,</hi> not only <hi>quà pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> But the Law of <hi>Grace</hi> is to oblige, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a sinner <hi>quà peccator Redemptus &amp; Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus est.</hi> And as Laws of men are distinguished, some being for defending the <hi>just</hi> some for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>unjust;</hi> some for <hi>loyal</hi> Subjects, some for those that have been disloyal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so may we say of God's Laws. But the differing ends here included are more considerable.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So from the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> or the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Rights</hi> constituted, are God's Laws distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some constitute only the <hi>dueness</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Penalty:</hi> (as the remnant of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> or pure Morals, which lost the adjoyned Promise, and so stood alone to <hi>Adam</hi> before the Promise was made: I say <hi>alone,</hi> though not without mercy and possibility of remedy, yet without any <hi>Promise</hi> of a remedy revealed.) Other Laws of God have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Promise and Threatning, as is aforesaid.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Some Laws are of God's own <hi>immediate</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, though he may use a Scribe to cause the <hi>sign,</hi> or a Herald to <hi>promulgate</hi> them, yet no ones <hi>Will</hi> enterposeth to give them a <hi>Being:</hi> Such are the Laws of <hi>Nature and Scripture.</hi> Other Laws of God are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61305:451"/> so his, as that <hi>immediately</hi> they are the <hi>Laws of men:</hi> Such are all Laws of Common-wealths and Churches, which are not against God's special Laws, but according to their general Determinations and Directions: Which are all only as Under-Laws, to be made and altered <hi>pro re nata;</hi> which it was not fit should be determined a-like to all Ages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by one universal, standing Law; nor yet did God think fit to be called down to every alteration, so as to be the visible Governour of each Church and Commonwealth: And therefore he hath entrusted a certain Legislative power for such under-Laws in the hand of his Officers; and what they do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Commission, he owneth and maketh it his own Laws; and so commandeth us in the Fifth Commandment to obey them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Lastly, God's Laws are much differenced from the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Sanction.</hi> And so the <hi>Threatning</hi> of his <hi>first Law,</hi> though it <hi>shewed no remedy,</hi> yet it <hi>excluded not all possibility</hi> of remedy nor was a <hi>peremptory undissolvable</hi> Obligation: Much less is the <hi>remaining</hi> part of it so now, when the Covenant of Grace is made. But the <hi>Threatning</hi> of the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> to the <hi>final non-performers</hi> of the <hi>Conditions</hi> of that Covenant, is a <hi>peremptory Threatning,</hi> and its Obligation is <hi>remediless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolvable.</hi> This is because God hath adjoyned to it a <hi>Prediction,</hi> that there shall be no more Sacrifice for sin, nor remedy, nor escape. Thus much of the several Specifications or Distributions of God's Laws.</p>
                  <p>Here note these two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I have not instanced all this while, in the Law of the Jews Church or Common-wealth as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61305:452"/> such, because the Explication of it hath such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that cannot thus <hi>obiter</hi> and cursorily be opened.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From what is said it may appear, that the first and most eminent distribution of God's Laws, as standing at the greatest difference, is between that made to <hi>Adam in Innocency,</hi> and that made by the <hi>Redeemer for our Recovery.</hi> For in almost all the forementioned respects are they differenced, as I have shewed already. And the second most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent distribution of God's universal Laws, is into the remnant of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> Creation, or pure Morals, as now put into the hand of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the proper <hi>Law of the Redeemer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lex remedians,</hi> a Law of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Note also, That because the <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory</hi> part is the <hi>principal</hi> part of <hi>this Law,</hi> it being purposely a <hi>remedying Law,</hi> an Act of Oblivion, therefore it is more commonly called the <hi>Covenant</hi> than the <hi>Law,</hi> and more commonly and properly called the <hi>Promise</hi> than the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also (or sometime) a <hi>Testament</hi> though some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it;) and oft a <hi>Constitution, Disposition, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is a <hi>Law,</hi> and oft and properly also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Law.</hi> But the Law of <hi>Works</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> was principally contained in the <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi> insomuch, as it seemeth a very hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with some, Whether there were <hi>any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> or Promise at all or no. There is none found written, unless implied in the Threat; and that is hard to be concluded, seing every threat of death implieth not a promise of everlasting life: And whether it were contained in <hi>nature or no,</hi> is hard to say.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61305:452"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paraeus in Proem. ad Comment. in Rom.</hi> denieth that there is <hi>any Covenant of Nature,</hi> but only of <hi>Grace;</hi> and saith, <hi>God cannot naturally</hi> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Creature. Others think, that though in point of <hi>Commutative Justice</hi> he could not, yet as <hi>Rector ob sines Regiminis secundum Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam distributivam,</hi> he was <hi>quasi obligatus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man perfectly obeying, though <hi>how far</hi> they dare not say. These things are left very dark, or at least, we see little of them. But (though it be probable by some passages in the Gospel, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Reason, that <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Promise</hi> not only of continuing in that felicity, but of a <hi>greater;</hi> yet) I never read, to my remembrance, the name of <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> used of that Law to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third most observable distribution of God's Laws, is between the Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Church and Common-wealth</hi> of the Jews, and the <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>Law of Grace</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences I will not now adventure on; only I shall say these three things: 1. That one was but particular to one people, the other universal: 2. That among the Jews, this was by an excellency called <hi>the Law,</hi> so that they in a manner appropriated hat term to it, as if they knew no other Law. 3. That therefore in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles it is this <hi>Judicial Law</hi> that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>[The Law,]</hi> and which he disputeth against directly and expresly in the Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and whose Abrogation he so contends for, and which he sets against the Law of Faith, and the Grace and Truth that came by Jesus Christ. If this be not observed, the Scripture, especially <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, will not be understood.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61305:453"/>
                  <p> The fourth most observable difference between God's Laws is between the <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> or the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> as <hi>before Christ</hi> and the same as <hi>after Christ.</hi> This difference, though very great, yet is <hi>mostly</hi> but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental in the Promulgation. At first it was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more obscurely, and after more clearly: At first eminently to <hi>one Nation,</hi> and after <hi>universally</hi> to the Catholick Church (and for the gathering of it first:) So that the term <hi>[Gospel]</hi> is appropriate to that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, which was <hi>after Christ;</hi> and the <hi>former</hi> called only the <hi>Promise.</hi> Yet <hi>some</hi> difference <hi>more</hi> than <hi>accidental</hi> here is between these two: For 1. They <hi>before Christ,</hi> were bound to believe only <hi>in a Messiah</hi> in general; we are bound to believe that <hi>Jesus Christ is he,</hi> or we shall die in our sins: They were to believe in him as <hi>to come;</hi> we, <hi>as come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:</hi> A more general dark Belief would save them it was not so necessary to Salvation to know his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> and <hi>coming again to Judgment;</hi> (for sure the Disciples were in a state of Salvation, when they knew not these: But now all these are necessary to Salvation to be known. 2. The <hi>matter</hi> of their <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Redeemer, was not then the same as now: Then they must shew sincere Obedience partly in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Jewish Law;</hi> but now not so: Nay, we have Sacraments newly instituted, and Churches otherwise ordered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. More of the Spirit and Grace was poured out after Christ than before; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, as that eminent degree hath the name of <hi>[the Spirit]</hi> oft appropriated to it: And so it is said, the Disciples had not yet received the Spirit, because Christ was not yet glorified: And it is called the Spirit of Promise, that is the promised
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61305:453"/> Spirit. So much for the Distribution of God's Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. The nature or use of a <hi>Law,</hi> is to be the rule of our actions, and of God's Judgment: <hi>Regula actionum Moralium, &amp; norma judicii,</hi> because it constituteth what is due both <hi>from us,</hi> and <hi>to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. Whatever Law therefore is in force for us to <hi>line by,</hi> we must necessarily be <hi>judged</hi> by it: And whatever Law we are <hi>judged</hi> by, we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>justified</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> by: For <hi>judging</hi> is the <hi>genus,</hi> which existeth not but in these <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 14. To <hi>justifie</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> a man according to the Law, as the rule of Judgment is to <hi>judg</hi> that the <hi>reward</hi> is <hi>due,</hi> or <hi>not due;</hi> or the <hi>punishment due,</hi> or <hi>not due</hi> to him, according to the tenor of that Law; that is, that he is <hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> when he is charged with a fault, and to have no right to the reward, or to be liable to the penalty, because of his fault.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 15. To be <hi>guiltless,</hi> is to be <hi>just in sensu forensi</hi> against <hi>these Accusations:</hi> To be one, 1. That is saultless; 2. Or to whom the benefit or <hi>reward</hi> is due, or to whom the penalty is <hi>not due</hi> according to that Law, this is to be <hi>just.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. He that is <hi>thus just,</hi> is <hi>therefore justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, because</hi> he is <hi>just:</hi> For the <hi>justitia Causae, &amp; ita personae quoad hanc causam,</hi> is it which is to be

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 17. Yet that which is the <hi>cause</hi> of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in <hi>sensu forensi,</hi> is not always a <hi>proper cause in a Physical sense;</hi> but sometime only an Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or <hi>Dispositio materiae,</hi> or <hi>Causa sine qua non:</hi> The Cause that is to be tried.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 18. Though <hi>mediately (quod ad reatum culpae)</hi> it be the Precept that will be the rule to judg men just or unjust by, yet ultimately it is the <hi>penal</hi> or <hi>premiant</hi> act of the Law, the <hi>Promise</hi> or the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> which is it that concludeth men <hi>just</hi> or <hi>unjust,</hi> and is the immediate rule of justifying or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and not the Precept or Prohibition. These do but determine <hi>de Debito Officii,</hi> or what was or shall be <hi>due from us to God;</hi> but the final business of the Judgment, is to determine what is <hi>due fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 19. It is therefore the <hi>Condition</hi> of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> or <hi>Threatning,</hi> that will be the very thing by which we must be tried: (For the <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Promise</hi> which is <hi>conditional.)</hi> And the Question of the day will be, <hi>Whether we did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 20. That which is our performance of the Condition of the Promise, and not committing the Condition of the Threat, is therefore our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Righteousness,</hi> by which we are justified in that Judgment against the Accusation of non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 21. As there was a <hi>Two-fold Law entire,</hi> consisting of Precepts, Threatning, and Promise, (or at least the two first, by the consent of all, were in the First Law) made upon a double ground of Legislation, to a different End, a different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so is there a <hi>Two-fold Judgment,</hi> and so a <hi>Two-fold Justification</hi> and <hi>Condemnation:</hi> One by God as <hi>Rector,</hi> according to the pure <hi>Law of Works,</hi> as <hi>Creator:</hi> The other by God in <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Redeemed World,</hi> upon the terms, and by the Law of Grace. The Judgment of God-Creator, according to the Law of Works, hath two parts and seasons, according as that Law doth much differ as it stood entirely in Innocency, and without Remedy, till the promise of Grace; and as it stands in part, and with that Redeeming Promise since.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Judgment that God held, was after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> when as <hi>Creator</hi> according to that first Law, he sat upon the Offendors, and <hi>passed the Sentence of Condemnation on all Mankind:</hi> but before the <hi>Execution,</hi> yea even <hi>in the Judgment,</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi> as it were <hi>interposing;</hi> that is, God in mercy resolving upon, and promising a way for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61305:455"/> the rescuing of the Offendor by the Satisfaction of his Justice; he look'd upon that Satisfaction and Sacrifice as <hi>in esse morali;</hi> and upon consideration of it as future, he past a Sentence of <hi>Conditional Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> in a <hi>Promise</hi> of the Messias to bruise the Serpent. But this was but somewhat obscurely done: Hereupon he prescribed typifying Bloody Sacrifices as the Conditions in part, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61305:455"/> of <hi>Conditional Absolution,</hi> twice, or two ways: First, He did by a Voice from Heaven pronounce, <hi>[This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased, bear ye him]; q. d.</hi> [According to his undertaking he is Incarnate, and is now satisfying my Jastice, and doth all that I require at his hands for Man's Redemption. This is he in whom my Wrath is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased to the World, (not absolutely to acquit them, but) so far that if they will <hi>Hear him,</hi> they shall live]. Next this, The Lord Jesus himself having taken fuller possession of his Dominion and Empire, doth most clearly publish the New-Law of Grace: That, <hi>[Whoever doth Repent and Believe, shall be pardoned and saved,</hi> &amp;c.] This Law is an <hi>Act of Pardon:</hi> And being so oft spoken by God himself, and now by Christ in the flesh, it is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a General <hi>Sentence of Judgment.</hi> Not as Absolutely and Actually pardoning <hi>particular</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for so it is but a Law of Grace, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of it on Condition: But as it is the solemn Pronunciation of a General and <hi>Conditional Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> to all Mankind, so it is a kind of Sentence, or equivalent thereto. And thus God the Father as <hi>Rector,</hi> according to the Law of Works, hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by an Act of Grace, <hi>Justified Conditionally</hi> the <hi>fore-condemned World.</hi> And this <hi>Conditional Justification</hi> is not to be sleighted, because but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,</hi> and because that many afterwards perish: For it is a <hi>pure free Gift;</hi> and the Condition is but the <hi>accepting</hi> of <hi>the Gift according to its Nature, viz▪ Christ</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> And <hi>Acceptance</hi> is so <hi>naturally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed necessary</hi> in all <hi>Gifts,</hi> that it is not used to be <hi>expressed</hi> as a <hi>Civil Condition,</hi> but <hi>implyed</hi> among ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Men and the Gift called <hi>Absolute,</hi> (though
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61305:456"/> indeed so far Conditional); And Refusal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude useth to deprive Men of those Gifts which the Laws of Men call <hi>Absolute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, it belongeth not to <hi>God as Legislator,</hi> to give Men <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>accept his Gift</hi> (but in another Relation): And he <hi>gives</hi> Christ, and Pardon, and Right to Life, as <hi>Legislator</hi> and <hi>Rector secundum Leges,</hi> and as <hi>Benefactor</hi> together.

                  <p> But seeing it was never in the thoughts of the Father or Mediator to make us <hi>Gods,</hi> and exempt us from his Government; therefore <hi>a Lord</hi> we must still have, and therefore <hi>a Law:</hi> and he was pleased by <hi>a Law</hi> to <hi>make</hi> the <hi>foresaid Justification,</hi> and <hi>convey</hi> to us our <hi>Right</hi> in Christ and his Benefits. And <hi>this Law</hi> imposeth on us <hi>Duty</hi> to the <hi>Lord-Redeemer,</hi> and constituteth the <hi>Conditions</hi> on which we shall live by him, and so is of use for the Application of his Benefits; and according to this <hi>New-Law</hi> the <hi>Redeemer</hi> that hath bought us, doth <hi>here govern us;</hi> therefore according to <hi>this Law</hi> will <hi>he judg</hi> us.

                  <p>I will not dare to determine that there will then be no use of the Law of Works as a Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (but none as the <hi>Only Rule</hi> to any); or that there will be no justifying Men from the Guilt of Death as due, according to the Sentence of that first Law.</p>
                  <p>But these things I may say, 1. That if there be any <hi>Accusation</hi> of Men <hi>merely as sinners,</hi> and as guilty of Death by the <hi>first Law,</hi> then must there be at Judgment a double <hi>Justification</hi> requisite against a <hi>double Accusation.</hi> One is against the <hi>true Accusation,</hi> that is, we <hi>sinned</hi> against the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> and thereby deserved the <hi>Penalty.</hi> Against this (confessing our sins) we plead, The <hi>Blood of Christ procuring us pardon,</hi> and that Pardon as <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> us <hi>conditionally</hi> in the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> Then comes the <hi>second Justification</hi> to be necessary, in that here we are devolved over to the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and to be tryed by the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and his <hi>Law:</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61305:457"/> then the Question is only, Whether we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> or <hi>not?</hi> Against the <hi>false Accusations</hi> [that we <hi>have not]</hi> we must be justified by our <hi>Actual Performance,</hi> as the <hi>Matter</hi> of our Righteousness. This Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>subordinate</hi> to the former; and by this the former is brought to perfection, and so we are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely justified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note also; That the Scripture doth so much <hi>suppose</hi> our <hi>Antecedent Conditional Justification</hi> by <hi>God-Creator</hi> in the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> that it seemeth to describe the <hi>general Judgment,</hi> as if that former were done already, and the latter only or mainly were apt to do, as the Work of that Day, as the means of making the first <hi>absolute.</hi> For <hi>Christ as Redeemer</hi> shall be the <hi>Judg;</hi> and for <hi>loving</hi> or <hi>not loving himself</hi> in his <hi>Members,</hi> shall the <hi>Sentence</hi> pass: not upon the mere terms of the Law of Works, but for improving or not<hi>-improving</hi> their Talents of Grace, I mean of Mercy received from the Redeemer. Here is therefore a <hi>Particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> from the <hi>false Charge</hi> of non-performance of the Gospel-Conditions, necessary; and also a <hi>General Justification</hi> from the <hi>guilt of all sin</hi> indeed committed, necessary, as the conjunct Grounds of the <hi>total</hi> and <hi>final Ʋniversal Absolution.</hi> Which we may, according to the tenor of the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of as in this order, (and so produceth also the Justification in our Consciences, according to the Rule of the same Law).</p>
                  <p>First, The great Question is, <hi>Whether the Sinner is to be sent to Heaven or to Hell? Saved or Damned?</hi> The Accuser saith, <hi>He is to be damned.</hi> (Here's the Accusation <hi>de fine).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61305:457"/>
                  <p> His first Accusation, as the <hi>Reason</hi> is, <hi>[Lord, he hath broke thy Law, which saith, The Soul that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth shall die].</hi> The Justifier saith, <hi>[I pardoued all Men for the sake of the Blood of the Redeemer, on Condition of Faith and Repentance].</hi> (This part of the Judgment, that in the Gospel-Description seemeth to suppose as done).</p>
                  <p>The next Charge or Accusation is, <hi>[Lord, he did not truly believe and repent, and therefore hath no benefit by the Law of Grace:</hi> (or else) <hi>He added not sincere Obedience, or did not persevere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath lost his Right to thy Pardon].</hi> Against this we are justified by pleading <hi>Not-guilty;</hi> that is, That we did <hi>Believe.

                  <p>By all this it appeareth that <hi>Justification</hi> being considered, 1. As opposite to <hi>Accusation;</hi> 2. As opposite to <hi>Condemnation;</hi> That there is a <hi>Two-fold Accusation,</hi> and consequently a <hi>Two-fold Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> opposite thereto, and that there is a <hi>Two-fold Condemnation</hi> of the wicked <hi>virtually</hi> in Law: Also that there is one <hi>final Peremptory Sentence</hi> of Condemnation in Judgment, which shall pass upon them upon this double Ground. And there is one <hi>final Sentence</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> for the Justification of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Judgment; which passeth also on the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground of the foresaid double Justification, as opposite to Accusation: of which the first only is Justification <hi>a Reatu,</hi> the second, <hi>Contra Reatum falsum impactum; vel quod rei non sumus:</hi> These
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61305:458"/> are done in Law at our first Believing, from which time forward there is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ; but before they were in Christ by Faith, there was a Condemnation. Also that though there be <hi>two Laws</hi> that <hi>Condemn,</hi> yet there is but <hi>one</hi> that <hi>Justifieth;</hi> though that one hath a double justifying force, from the foresaid double Accusation; wherefore one is <hi>à Condemnatione Legis veteris;</hi> the other is <hi>ne Condemnemur Lege novâ, vel in Judicio per Legem novam.</hi> Which I make all plain thus.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Law of <hi>Works</hi> condemneth Men as <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> (still pardoned).</item>
                     <item>2. The Law of <hi>Grace</hi> condemneth them further as <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such sinners in specie, viz.</hi> as <hi>final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>The first of these the Law of <hi>Grace remitteth conditionally before Faith</hi> (to all) <hi>actually,</hi> upon <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi> The last is <hi>never remitted,</hi> nor any justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it.</p>
                  <p>I shewed before how there may be a double Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in Judgment: one true, that we were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Sinners: the other false, That we were to be condemned as Unbelievers, Rebels against Christ, or Apostates. We are justified from one by pleading Remission, and from the other by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Not-Guilty;</hi> that is, our <hi>personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in tantum,</hi> so far as that Charge extendeth. This is Justification by <hi>Plea</hi> or <hi>Apologie,</hi> whether by others or Christ as our Advocate: Upon which as the Ground, or <hi>Justitia Causae,</hi> follows the final absolute sentential Justification from the main charge (of being lyable to Damnation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no right to Salvation) by Christ as <hi>Judg.</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61305:458"/> Though it may be said also, That he justifieth in the foresaid subordinate sense, from the particular Accusations, (of being condemnable as Sinners, and being Unbelievers, and being Condemnable as Unbelievers) as Judg, both as he concludeth of the distinct parts of the Sentence before the sum or whole, and as he concludeth those Parts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the whole: First, Judging, <hi>[He is not condemnable for sin simply as against the Law of Works].</hi> Next, <hi>[He is not guilty of final non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of the Conditions of the Law of Grace; therefore not condemnable for that, or by that Law]:</hi> And then, <hi>[Therefore he is not condemnable at all, but hath Right to Life].</hi> That I doubt not but God will make Man capable of a shorter dispatch at that final Judgment, than we use to have at Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Barrs, and therefore our Pleadings will not be so particular and express. But yet as they will proceed on these Grounds, so this Order and these Reasons of the Sentence will be made manifest to the World, how short soever it be, and we shall be enabled to see the implyed Reason and Order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particular dilatory Expressions.</p>
                  <p>By this it appeareth that it is impossible that a Creature can be under any Law, whose Office it is to be the <hi>Rule of Actions</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> but he must be <hi>judged,</hi> and so either <hi>Justified</hi> or <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by that Law: which is expressed also in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by our being <hi>judged according to our Works;</hi> that is, his performing or not-performing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the premiant or penal Act of that Law. And to be <hi>judged according to our Works,</hi> is to be <hi>justified or condemned according to our Works:</hi> which <hi>Works</hi> must needs be <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> to be then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61305:459"/> tryed; and every <hi>Cause</hi> is <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Ʋnjust:</hi> and the justice of the <hi>Cause,</hi> is the justice of the <hi>Person</hi> as to that <hi>Cause:</hi> and a Man is therefore justified by the <hi>Judg,</hi> because he is <hi>just,</hi> his <hi>Cause being just.</hi> And so is it no hard matter for a willing unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mind, to see how Works do or do not justifie, though perhaps they may differ about the fitness of each others Notions and Expressions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>

And it's not inobservable, that the Apostle's Creed rather useth the term <hi>[For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sin],</hi> which poor People better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and not the term <hi>[Justification],</hi> about which the Learned have filled the World with needless Quarrels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forgiveness</hi> of Sin is not the <hi>whole Righteousness.</hi> God never forgiveth <hi>his sin,</hi> that hath <hi>nothing but sin:</hi> He never made a grant of the forgiveness of all sins, without Exceptions, but only of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of all upon <hi>condition</hi> of our performing the <hi>Gospel-Conditions:</hi> And the <hi>Condition</hi> is a plain <hi>Exception</hi> of the <hi>non-performance</hi> of it self, out of the Matter of the Pardon. Inherent Personal Righteousness is confessed by all Protestants and Christians. A Righteousness which makes not Righteous, so far, is a palpable Contradiction. To make Righteous, is to justifie <hi>Constitutivè.</hi> So far as any Man is <hi>Constituted Just,</hi> God will, 1. <hi>Esteem</hi> him, and <hi>Accept</hi> him as Just; 2. <hi>Sentence</hi> him Just; 3.

                  <p>To this I need to say no more than I have done already, because his Opinion is grounded on the former, That there is but one Law; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, this falls with it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s Error lyeth in his confounding <hi>Legem in genere, Cum hac Lege Operum in specie.</hi> A Law in general is a Determination or Constitution Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative <hi>de jure,</hi> and obligeth <hi>ad Obedientiam aut ad Poenam.</hi> But Laws are several ways <hi>specified,</hi> as is afore declared, and I will not repeat.</p>
                  <p>The Penalty proper to the New-Law, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in these Particulars following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To have no <hi>part in Christ,</hi> to be no Member of him, not united or espoused to him, is one part of the Penalty, as it is <hi>poena damni:</hi> Who will say that the Law of Works did threaten this? It would have been to <hi>Adam</hi> but a <hi>Negation,</hi> and no <hi>Privation,</hi> and so no Penalty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The like may be said of the <hi>missing of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Pardon</hi> of all sin; which is a part of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61305:460"/> the <hi>poena damni,</hi> which the Law of Works knew not. Before the Law of Grace was enacted, and by Christ's Blood and the Promise, Remission was made possible; yea, conditionally given, it would have been no Penalty, though a misery, not to be forgiven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The like may be said of the denyal of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace,</hi> and the help of the Spirit to them that quench it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the hopelesness of their Condition that sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And the non-liberation from eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But especially the <hi>Peremptory Sentence</hi> of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Execution according. The Law of Works being violated, the Communication was dispensable on valuable Considerations, and the Obligation to Punishment dissolvable, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment it self removable: But the New-Law hath affixed a prediction to the Commination, making the said Commination indispensable, the Obligation undissolvable, and the Punishment cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly everlasting and remediless; not only (as the <hi>first Law) providing no Remedy,</hi> but decreeing that <hi>none shall be provided</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>But I have mentioned these before, about the diversification of God's Laws, and there also men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a real difference in the <hi>Pain</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> between that which is threatned in the Law of Works, and of Grace. But if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> be resolved to confound these Sinners, and say God hath but <hi>one Law,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only at the general nature of a Law, when he should look at the distinct <hi>species,</hi> then there's no Remedy.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61305:461"/> 6. Our Sixth Controversie is; <hi>Whether the same thing which is the Condition of our Salvation</hi> (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> confesseth Obedience is) <hi>be not also a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our final sentential Justification, and of our Right to Salvation</hi> (though not of our <hi>first Right)?</hi> I affirm and he denies.</p>
                  <p>Our first Right to Salvation is given with our Justification or Pardon, upon our first believing: but our Obedience upon Opportunity is a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>non-amittendi,</hi> or without which it shall not <hi>continue,</hi> nor shall we have ever <hi>Jus in re.</hi> This I proved I think sufficiently in the Postscript of my Papers to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> but he easily put by all, with the distinction of <hi>[Right to Salvation]</hi> and <hi>[Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self].</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I consider his <hi>Exceptions,</hi> I will add this Answer to his Distinction. 1. He yeeldeth the whole Cause in acknowledging, 1. That <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and Right to Salvation have the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, (which he could not deny). 2. That O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is a Condition of Salvation. 3. For his Distinction is <hi>sine differentiâ;</hi> there is no such thing in the World, no nor possible, as a proper <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salvation,</hi> distinct from a <hi>Condition of Right to it.</hi> First, I hope, with any fair Dealer, I may take it for granted that he doth not equivocate in the word <hi>Condition,</hi> taking it for a mere <hi>Physical Qualification,</hi> called a <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Preparation,</hi> in another sense than ours; but that we are still speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Condition in sensu Civili, Legali, vel Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali:</hi> Not as the Dryness of the Wood, or the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to the Fire, is called a Condition of its Burning; nor as the valiant Mind of Souldiers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61305:461"/> is a Condition of their valiant Fighting and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, not imposed by the General, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally necessary by way of Qualification or Enable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but it is a Condition constituted by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Law, Covenant, or Testament that we are speaking of. 1. I so explained my Mind fully. 2. The subject-Matter of our Dispute will be on no other sensed Condition; so that I may well take it for granted, that we are agreed in this, and that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will not seek any Evasion by an Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this word.</p>
                  <p>And then the Case is past question; for every Condition is a <hi>Condition of Right,</hi> which I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>It is a Condition of that which the Promise gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: But it is Right (to Salvation) which the Promise giveth; Therefore it is a Condition of Right (to Salvation). The Major is past dispute; it being the Condition of a Promise, and a part of that Promise, and its Office, to suspend the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Promise or Donative Act. The Minor is as far past dispute with all that know, that the proper product of Laws, Covenants, Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Right or Dueness. The Promise gives nothing else immediately and naturally but Right. As Sanctification, Glorification, Health, Riches, or any benefit not relative; the Promise gives but Right to them, (though it be called a giving the thing it self morally, because God doth infallibly fulfil his Promise): But it is by actual natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the thing it self must be after given or conveyed. Therefore seeing we speak not of a Condition in a Physical sense, (as Eating is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Living) but in a moral, or civil, or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61305:462"/> sense; it is past doubt that it's essential to a <hi>Condition</hi> to have a respect to <hi>Right,</hi> and to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio juris, vel obtinendi, vel retinendi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Assertors of the contrary be called to prove their distinction from the Scripture, you should see on what arbitrary Affirmations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their own, such Doctrines are built. For instance, when it is promised, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. That, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord shall be saved].</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>He became the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him].</hi> Prove now by such evidence as should move an impartial Man, that <hi>Believing</hi> only in the first Promise, and such other is <hi>Conditio juris;</hi> and that, <hi>[Calling on the Name of the Lord, and obeying]</hi> are not <hi>Conditiones juris, vel obtinendi, vel retinendi:</hi> That <hi>Faith</hi> only is a Condition in a judiciary sense, and Repentance, Love to God and Obedience are only Physically Conditions, or are Conditions of <hi>Salvation,</hi> but not of <hi>Right</hi> to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Prove that in the same Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 27. Faith is made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Condition of Right to God's Love, and Love to Christ is made a Condition of his Love, but not of Right to it; <hi>[For the Father himself lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you, because ye have loved me, and have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that I came out from God].</hi> Is here either rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or room for your distinction? <hi>[Because]</hi> is equally added to both, what-ever kind of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are. The Text saith expresly, <hi>[Blessed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e that by <hi>Right</hi> here is not meant <hi>Right?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61305:462"/>
                  <p> And again observe that <hi>Right</hi> to Salvation, and Right to Justification at Judgment, are not, yea, cannot be denyed to have the same Conditions: For that which justifieth our <hi>Cause,</hi> will justifie us: But that which proveth our Right to Salvation, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth our Cause: For our Right to Salvation, is our Cause it self to be then judged.</p>
                  <p>The Seventh Controversie is, <hi>Whether the words of the Gospel-Promise or Grant, forgiving sin, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Sentence of Absolution by God as Judg? Or rather an Act of Oblivion or Donation of Pardon and Life by God, partly as Benefactor, and partly as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, by Law and Guilt? Whether it be a Judicial Sentence only Virtually or Actually?</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> holdeth, that the words of the Gospel, [He that believeth shall be justified and saved]; are <hi>an actual sentence of God as Judg:</hi> I hold that it is but <hi>an Act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Condonation,</hi> and <hi>a Gift of Life by God as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and so but a <hi>Virtual Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first let it be noted, That all this is but a Controversie <hi>de nomine,</hi> and not <hi>de re.</hi> As long as we are agreed what this Act of Oblivion is, and what it doth, I take it to be a matter of no great noment, whether it be <hi>de nomine,</hi> to be called a <hi>Sentence of Judgment,</hi> properly or improperly. But my Reasons are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Gospel-Act is called by the name of a Law, both in Prophesies, and in the words of the Gospel it self, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3. and 8. 16, 20. &amp; 42. 4. &amp; 51. 4. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Jam.</hi> 11. 25. &amp; 2. 8, 12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61305:463"/> 2. It is <hi>NOrma actionum moralium &amp; norma judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis: Ergo,</hi> it is a Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2, 3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>John</hi> 12. 47, 48. &amp; 14. 23. &amp; 15. 7. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22, 23. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Day of Judgment is foretold and described in the Gospel, in which a final Sentence will pass on Men according to this Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The Law and Sentence are not to be confounded: For they are not all one: The <hi>Norma judicis,</hi> according to which Men must be judged, is not the Judgment it self.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Law is an universal Rule, and the sanction Conditional, and it neither justifieth nor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any antecedently, but only after they have kept or broken it; And then it doth it <hi>ut Lex,</hi> and not <hi>ut sententia judicis:</hi> But a <hi>judicial Sentence</hi> is about particular or individual Persons and Cases; and supposeth a Law kept or broken, and supposeth Accusation, (virtual or actual): and also the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cause to be judicially decided, is, Whether the Law condemn or absolve the Person (virtually): Therefore the Law and Sentence are no more to be confounded, than a Law giver and a Judg.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If it be a Sentence of Judgment, it is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <hi>secundum norm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m alicujus Legis;</hi> some Law is the Rule of it: But no Law is the Rule of it; <hi>Ergo▪</hi> it is no Sentence of Judgment, properly so called. If any Law be the Rule of it, it is either <hi>an Ʋniversal Law made to Mankind,</hi> or a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> Law (as that made to <hi>Noah,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the Jews by <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c.) Not the latter: If the former, it must be that called the Law of Nature, and Covenant of Works made to <hi>Adam,</hi> or the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61305:463"/> Law or Covenant of Grace made in Christ: Not the first: For to say, [He that believeth shall be saved], is not to Sentence as Judg according to the Law, [In the day that thou sinnest thou shalt die]. Not the latter; for then the Law and the Judgment were all one; and to say, [He that believeth shall be saved], would be all one as to say, <hi>[John</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> hath right to Salvation according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, because they are true Believers]. He that is not satisfied with thus much, let him think as he list, for I shall trouble the Reader with no more.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth Controversie is, <hi>Whether the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ upon Believers after this Life, be not properly a justifying Sentence?</hi> I affirm it, and Mr. <hi>G.</hi> denyeth it, and taketh it to be only a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Justification which we had in this Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every <hi>judicial Sentence,</hi> is a <hi>Declaration;</hi> but every <hi>Declaration</hi> is not a <hi>judicial Sentence.</hi> This Question therefore is not, Whether it be a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but whether it be not such a Declaration as is a <hi>Sentence of the Judg</hi> in Judgment? And if so, Whether it be not a <hi>proper Justification,</hi> (though here also I know, according to his meaning, the Question is but <hi>de nomine).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is a proper Sentence of Judgment, which is the publick Declaration and Decision of the <hi>Judg,</hi> to put our Right to Salvation out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, against all Accusers, and to give us our <hi>Jus Judicatum,</hi> by determining of our <hi>Jus Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuturi;</hi> and this as an orderly means to our full possession. But such will be <hi>Christ's Sentence</hi> at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61305:464"/> the Last Judgment; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it will be properly a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Sentence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture doth most exactly describe it as a <hi>proper Judgment;</hi> It calleth it the Act of Christ as Judg; It calleth it a Judgment: It descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the Cause, the Persons, the Plea, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Sentence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22, 24, 26, 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. &amp; 9. 27. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 14. &amp; 11. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. throughout.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an Article of our Creed, That Christ shall come again to judg the quick and the dead; and among Christians past dispute. And if he <hi>judg,</hi> he <hi>sentenceth</hi> as Judg. And if he sentence as Judg, it is either a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Justification,</hi> or of <hi>Condemnation:</hi> All Judgment which is the <hi>genus,</hi> is found in one of these <hi>special Acts;</hi> There is no middle. It is a Judgment of <hi>Condemnation</hi> or of <hi>Justification.</hi> If the <hi>Name</hi> be questioned, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all Lawyers, all Men that live in Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and all Divines; especially Protestants, who maintain against the Papists, that the word <hi>Justifie</hi> is most commonly taken in the New Testament in a <hi>judiciary Sense,</hi> for either the <hi>Sentence</hi> of a <hi>Judg,</hi> or the Plea of an Advocate at Judgment. I think this Controversie needeth no more words. And if I should here cite an hundred Divines that call this Last Judgment by the name of a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> or <hi>Condemnation,</hi> I should merit nothing of the Reader, but rebuke for troubling him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary words.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61305:464"/>
                  <p> And now having reviewed all that I find remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controverted, between this Learned, Reverend and Pious Brother and my self, about the Matter which he thought meet to Animadvert on, (or at least all that is worth the Reader's notice). I am glad that our Differences are brought into so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a room; and that it is very doubtful whether every one of them be not only <hi>de nomine:</hi> And I think it but a needless trouble to the Reader, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all his numerous Citations out of <hi>Amesius, Piscator, Paraeus, Zanchy, Calvin, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. and such late Divines, which make up the main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Reply: Nor to make so tedious an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Whether he or I do best understand those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Sense: The Controversies themselves being cleared, I have done. And my design is but this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To perswade Divines not to make God's Servants believe that they differ in great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Matters, and so to render them unfit for each others Love and Communion, when they differ but in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Logical Notions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To perswade Men to suffer their Brethren peaceably to rest in <hi>that Truth,</hi> and those <hi>Expressions</hi> of it, which are found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Church Ʋniversal</hi> for above a <hi>thousand years rested in,</hi> and not make <hi>Humane Notions</hi> seem necessary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Church-Communion: Nor in a siding Humour to set the Phrases of some late honoured Divines, against Scripture and the Universal Church, and then to make them Engines of destruction, by making them seem needful Truths, which are but new incongruous Notions, which must at last be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued, to force them to confess that their meaning is the same with that which others long have taught.</p>

                  <p>I Must intreat the Reader, when he judgeth of the Second Case, (about the Interest of <hi>Works</hi> with Faith, in our Title to Life) to remember, That the Question is not;</p>

                  <p>But I must intreat him to see the Case stated in the Preface to my Disputations of Justification, and to remember that those that I oppose do hold;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Faith it self, as an Act of ours, is part of the Works to be denied as a Means or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Justification, and so a part of that Subordinate Righteousness, and that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it only as an Instrument.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They say, That he seeks the prohibited Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works, who looketh to be justified by

                  <p n="3">3. Much more he that thinketh Repentance, Love to Christ, Desire of him, Prayer for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any other Act of Man, is a Means or Condition of our Justification or Pardon: To be justified by any such Act but as part of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be justified by Works.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Much more to make sincere Obedience the Condition of Continued or Final Justification in Judgment. See the rest of the Controversies in the aforecited Preface and Books. And also in my <hi>Pacification</hi> or <hi>Catholick Theology,</hi> where this Cause is handled positively and defensively: And he that blameth me for writing so many Books of the same thing, should be one that first considereth how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books and daily Invectives and Censures of Men that never understood the Cause, have called me to it, and made it necessary. Four or five Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines rose in <hi>Holland,</hi> especially at <hi>Frankera,</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the excellent <hi>Amesius</hi> his better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours) who have owned ill Definitions of God's Covenants, and laid the Foundations of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Libertinism, (especially <hi>Maccovius,</hi> and <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and <hi>Cocceius,</hi> and <hi>Cloppenburgius</hi> too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented) making the Covenant in Constitution to be nothing but Election by Eternal Decree, and the Covenant in Execution, to be the fulfilling or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Decree of Election in all our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and Justification to be but God's eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and Man's Justification in <hi>Conscience,</hi> and before Men, with other such confounding Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when verily the better Description of God's

                  <p>WHen this Book was coming out of the Press, I received another Book of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> against Infants Baptism, in which he mentloneth Dr. <hi>Tullies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> what a <hi>Papist</hi> I am, in his <hi>Justif. Paul.</hi> (with Dr. <hi>Pierces</hi> former Charges) and lamenting that no more yet but <hi>one Dr. Tully</hi> hath <hi>come forth to Encounter me,</hi> Epist. and Pag. 224. The perusal of that Book (with Mr. <hi>Tombs short Reflections)</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth me to say but this instead of any further Confutation.</p>
                  <p>That it is (as the former) so full of false Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations set off with the greatest Audacity (even a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ines of my own about our meeting at Saint <hi>James</hi>'s left with the Clerk, grosly falsified) and former falsifications partly justified, and partly past over, and his most passionate Charges ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61305:467"/> upon Mistakes, and managed by Misreports, sometime of <hi>Words,</hi> sometime of the <hi>Sense,</hi> and sometime of <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact;</hi> in short, it is such a bundle of <hi>Mistake, Fierceness</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> that I take it for too <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>unpleasant</hi> a Work to give the World a particular Detection of these Evils. If I had so little to do with my Time as to write it, I suppose that few would find leisure to read it: And I desire no more of the willing Reader, then seriously to peruse my Book <hi>(More Reasons for Infants Church-membership)</hi> with his, and to examine the Authors about whose Words or Sense we differ. Or if any would be Informed at a cheaper rate, he may read Mr. <hi>Barrets</hi> Fifty <hi>Queries</hi> in two sheets. And if Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> revile me, for not transcribing or answering more of his <hi>Great Book,</hi> when I tell the Reader that I <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to have the Book before him,</hi> and am not bound to transcribe such a Volume already in Print, and that I answer as much as I think needs an Answer, leaving the rest as I found it to the Judgment of each Reader, he may himself take this for a <hi>Reply;</hi> but I must judg of it as it is.</p>
                  <p>I find but one thing in the Book that needeth any other Answer, than to peruse what is already Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: And that is about Baptizing Naked: My Book was written 1649. A <hi>little before, common uncontrolled Fame was,</hi> that not <hi>far from us</hi> in <hi>one place many of them</hi> were <hi>Baptized naked,</hi> reproving the Cloathing way as Antiscriptural: I never heard Man deny this Report: I conversed with divers of Mr. <hi>Tomber</hi>'s Church, who denied it not: As ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any denied it <hi>to me,</hi> so I never <hi>read</hi> one that did deny it to my knowledg: He now tells me Mr.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61305:467"/>
                     <hi>Fisher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haggar,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> did: Let any Man read Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> Answer to me, yea and that Passage by him now cited, and see whether there be a word of denial: Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> or <hi>Haggar</hi> I never saw: Their Books I had seen, but never read two Leaves to my remembrance of Mr. <hi>Fishers,</hi> though I numbered it with those that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on that Subject, as well I might: I knew his Education and his Friends, and I saw the Great Volume before he turned <hi>Quaker,</hi> but I thought it enough to read Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and others that wrote before him, but I read not him, nor all Mr. <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars:</hi> If I had, I had not taken them for compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of a fact <hi>far from them,</hi> and that <hi>three years</hi> after: Could they say, that <hi>no one ever did so?</hi> The truth is that three years after, mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my words, as if I had affirmed it to be <hi>their ordinary practice</hi> (as you may read in them) which I never did, nor thought, they vehemently deny this: (And such <hi>heedless reading</hi> occasioneth many of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Accusations). I never said that <hi>no Man ever denied it;</hi> for I have not read <hi>all that ever was written,</hi> nor spoken with all the World: But <hi>no Man ever denied it to me,</hi> nor did I <hi>ever read any that denied it.</hi> And in a matter of Fact, if that Fame be not credible, which is of things <hi>Late</hi> and <hi>Near,</hi> and not <hi>Contradicted</hi> by <hi>any one</hi> of the <hi>most interessed Persons themselves,</hi> no not by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himself, we must surcease humane Converse: Yet do I not thence undertake that the same was true, either of <hi>those Persons,</hi> or such as other Writers beyond Sea have said it off. I <hi>saw not</hi> any one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> or any other in <hi>River</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by <hi>Dipping at Age:</hi> If you <hi>do no such thing,</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61305:468"/> I am sorry that I believed it, and will recant it. Had <hi>I not seen</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> go naked through <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> at the Assizes, and read the <hi>Ranters</hi> Letters full of Oathes, I could have proved neither of them. And yet I know not where so long after to find my Witnesses: I abhor Slanders, and receiving ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports unwarrantably: I well know that this is not their ordinary Practice: The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not those things now, which many did at the rising of the Sect; and if I could, I would believe they never did them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Book of Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> with the rest of the same kind, increase my hatred of the <hi>Disputing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious</hi> way of writing, and my trouble that the Cause of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> hath so oft put on me a necessity to write in a Disputing way, against the Writings of so many Assailants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It increaseth my Grief for the Case of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yea of well-meaning godly Christians, who are unable to judg of many Controversies agitated, otherwise than by some Glimpses of poor Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the esteem which they have of the Persons which do manage them, and indeed take their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon trust from those whom they most reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and value; and yet can so hardly know whom to follow, whilst the grossest Mistakes are set off with as great confidence and holy pretence, as the greatest Truths. O how much should Christians be pitied, that must go through so great Temptations!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It increaseth my Resolution, had I longer to live, to converse with Men that I would <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> by, either as a <hi>Learner</hi> hearing what they <hi>have</hi> to say, without importunate Contradiction, or as a <hi>Teacher</hi> if they desire to Learn of me: A <hi>School</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61305:468"/> way may do something to increase Knowledg; but <hi>drenching Men,</hi> and <hi>striving</hi> with them, doth but set them on a fiercer striving against the Truth: And when they that have need of seven and seven years Schooling more, under some clear well studied Teacher, are made Teachers themselves, and then turned loose into the World (as <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes) to militate <hi>for</hi> and <hi>with</hi> their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> what must the Church suffer by such Contenders?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It increaseth my dislike of that Sectarian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding hurtful Zeal, which is described <hi>James</hi> 3. and abateth <hi>my</hi> wonder at the rage of Persecutors: For I see that the same Spirit maketh the same kind of Men, even when they most cry out against Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and separate furthest from them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It resolveth me more to enquire less after the Answers to Mens <hi>Books</hi> than I have done: And I shall hereafter think never the worse of a Mans writings, for hearing that they are answered: For I see it is not only easie for a <hi>Talking Man</hi> to <hi>talk on,</hi> and to <hi>say something for</hi> or <hi>against any thing,</hi> but it is <hi>hard</hi> for them to <hi>do otherwise,</hi> even to hold their <hi>Tongues,</hi> or <hi>Pens,</hi> or <hi>Peace:</hi> And when I change this Mind, I must give the greatest <hi>belief</hi> to <hi>Women</hi> that will talk most, or to them that <hi>live longest,</hi> and so are like to have the last word, or to them that can train up militant Heirs and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to defend them when they are dead, and so propagate the Contention. If a sober Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first and second writing (yea of <hi>positive Principles)</hi> will not inform me, I shall have little hope to be much the wifer for all the rest.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I am fully satisfied that even good Men are here so far from Perfection, that they must bear
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61305:469"/> with odious faults and injuries in one another, and be habituated to a ready and easie forbearing and forgiving one another. I will not so much as describe or denominate Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Citations of Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> to prove my Popery and Crimes, nor his passages about the Wars, and about my Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Self-contradictions, and Repentances, lest I do that which savoureth not of Forgiveness: O what need have we all of Divine Forgiveness!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I shall yet less believe what any Mans <hi>Opinion</hi> (yea or Practice) is by his <hi>Adversaries Sayings, Collections, Citations,</hi> or most vehement Assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than ever I have done, though the Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pretend to never so much Truth, and pious Zeal.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I shall less trust a <hi>confounding ignorant</hi> Reader or Writer, that hath not an accurate <hi>defining</hi> and <hi>distinguishing</hi> Understanding, and hath not a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exercised, discerning</hi> Knowledg than ever I have done; and especially if he be engaged in a <hi>Sect</hi> (which alas, how few parts of the Christian World escape!) For I here (and in many others) see, that you have no way to seem Orthodox with such, but to run quite into the contrary Extream: And if I write against both Extreams, I am taken by such Men as this, but to be <hi>for both and against both,</hi> and to <hi>contradict my self.</hi> When I write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Persecutors, I am one of the Sectaries, and when I write against the Sectaries, I am of the Persecutors side: If I belie not the Prelatists, I am a Conformist: If I belie not the <hi>Anabaptists, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants,</hi> &amp;c. I am one of them: If I belie not the Papists, I am a Papist; if I belie not the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, I</hi> am an <hi>Arminian;</hi> if I belie not the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61305:469"/> I am with <hi>Pseudo-Tilenus</hi> and his Brother, <hi>purus putus Puritanus,</hi> and one <hi>Qui totum Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nismum totus spirat</hi> (which <hi>Joseph Allen</hi> too kindly interpreteth): If <hi>I</hi> be for <hi>lawful Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>lawful Liturgies</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> I am a <hi>temporizing Conformist:</hi> If <hi>I</hi> be for <hi>no more, I</hi> am an intollerable Non-Conformist (at this time forced to part with House, and Goods, and Library, and all save my Clothes, and to possess nothing, and yet my Death (by six months Imprisonment in the Common Goal) is sought after and continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. If <hi>I</hi> be as very <hi>a Fool,</hi> and as <hi>little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my self,</hi> and as much <hi>contradict my self,</hi> as all these Confounders and Men of Violence would have the World believe, it is much to <hi>my cost,</hi> being hated by them all while I seek but for the common peace.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But I have also further learned hence to <hi>take up my content in Gods Approbation,</hi> and (having done my duty, and pitying their own and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples snares) to make but small account of all the Reproaches of all sorts of Sectaries; what they will say against me living or dead, I leave to themselves and God, and shall not to please a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious Sect, or any Men whatever, be false to my Conscience and the Truth: If the Cause I defend be not of God, I desire it may fall: If it be, I leave it to God how far He will prosper it, and what Men shall think or say of me: And I will pray for Peace to him that will not hate and revile me for so doing. Farewell.</p>
